Krishna, the Lord of the universe and the Creator of every\\nobject, having reflected in his mind, thus commanded Maya,--\\'Let a\\npalatial sabha (meeting hall) as thou choosest, be built (by thee), if\\nthou, O son of Diti, who art the foremost of all artists, desirest to do\\ngood to Yudhishthira the just.

Yudhishthira received\\nMaya with respect, offering him the honour he deserved. And, O Bharata,\\nMaya accepted that honour thinking highly of it. O monarch of the Bharata\\nrace, that great son of Diti then recited unto the sons of Pandu the\\nhistory of the Danava Vrisha-parva, and that foremost of artists then,\\nhaving rested awhile, set himself after much thoughtful planning to build\\na palace for the illustrious sons of Pandu. Agreeably to the wishes of\\nboth Krishna and the sons of Pritha, the illustrious Danava of great\\nprowess, having performed on an auspicious day the initial propitiatory\\nrites of foundation and having also gratified thousands of well-versed\\nBrahmanas with sweetened milk and rice and with rich presents of various\\nkinds, measured out a plot of land five thousand cubits square, which was\\ndelightful and exceedingly handsome to behold and which was favourable\\nfor construction of a building well-suited to the exigencies of every\\nseason.\"', '']\n"

Let her sweep the chambers, force her\\nthereto, and let the unfortunate one stay where our serving-women are.'\", '\"Vidura said,--\\'Dost thou not know, O wretch, that by uttering such harsh\\nwords thou art tying thyself with cords? Dost thou not understand that\\nthou art hanging on the edge of a precipice? Dost thou not know that\\nbeing a deer thou provokest so many tigers to rage? Snakes of deadly\\nvenom, provoked to ire, are on thy head! Wretch, do not further provoke\\nthem lest thou goest to the region of Yama. In my judgement, slavery does\\nnot attach to Krishna, in as much as she was staked by the King after he\\nhad lost himself and ceased to be his own master. Like the bamboo that\\nbeareth fruit only when it is about to die, the son of Dhritarashtra\\nwinneth this treasure at play. Intoxicated, he perceiveth nor in these\\nhis last moments that dice bring about enmity and frightful terrors. No\\nman should utter harsh speeches and pierce the hearts of the others. No\\nman should subjugate his enemies by dice and such other foul means. No\\none should utter such words as are disapproved by the Vedas and lead to\\nhell and annoy others. Some one uttereth from his lips words that are\\nharsh. Stung by them another burneth day and night. These words pierce\\nthe very heart of another. The learned, therefore, should never utter\\nthem, pointing them at others. A goat had once swallowed a hook, and when\\nit was pierced with it, the hunter placing the head of the animal on the\\nground tore its throat frightfully in drawing it out. Therefore, O\\nDuryodhana, swallow not the wealth of the Pandavas. Make them not thy\\nenemies. The sons of Pritha never use words such as these. It is only low\\nmen that are like dogs who use harsh words towards all classes of people,\\nviz., those that have retired to the woods, those leading domestic lives,\\nthose employed in ascetic devotions and those that are of great learning.\\nAlas! the son of Dhritarashtra knoweth not that dishonesty is one of the\\nfrightful doors of hell. Alas! many of the Kurus with Dussasana amongst\\nthem have followed him in the path of dishonesty in the matter of this\\nplay at dice. Even gourds may sink and stones may float, and boats also\\nmay always sink in water, still this foolish king, the son of\\nDhritarashtra, listeneth not to my words that are even as regimen unto\\nhim. Without doubt, he will be the cause of the destruction of the Kurus.\\nWhen the words of wisdom spoken by friends and which are even as fit\\nregimen are not listened to, but on the other hand temptation is on the\\nincrease, a frightful and universal destruction is sure to overtake all\\nthe Kurus.\"', '', 'Vaisampayana said,--\"Intoxicated with pride, the son of Dhritarashtra\\nspake,--\\'Fie on Kshatta! and casting his eyes upon the Pratikamin in\\nattendance, commanded him, in the midst of all those reverend seniors,\\nsaying,--\\'Go Pratikamin, and bring thou Draupadi hither. Thou hast no\\nfear from the sons of Pandu. It is Vidura alone that raveth in fear.\\nBesides, he never wisheth our prosperity!\\'\"', 'Vaisampayana continued,--\"Thus commanded, the Pratikamin, who was of the\\nSuta caste, hearing the words of the king, proceeded with haste, and\\nentering the abode of the Pandavas, like a dog in a lion\\'s den,\\napproached the queen of the sons of Pandu. And he said,--\\'Yudhishthira\\nhaving been intoxicated with dice, Duryodhana, O Draupadi, hath won thee.\\nCome now, therefore, to the abode of Dhritarashtra. I will take thee, O\\nYajnaseni, and put thee in some menial work.\\'', \"Draupadi said,--'Why, O Pratikamin, dost thou say so? What prince is\\nthere who playeth staking his wife? The king was certainly intoxicated\\nwith dice. Else, could he not find any other object to stake?'\", '\"The Pratikamin said,--\\'When he had nothing else to stake, it was then\\nthat Ajatasatru, the son of Pandu, staked thee. The king had first staked\\nhis brothers, then himself, and then thee, O princess.\\'', '\"Draupadi said,--\\'O son of the Suta race, go, and ask that gambler\\npresent in the assembly, whom he hath lost first, himself, or me.\\nAscertaining this, come hither, and then take me with thee, O son of the\\nSuta race.\\'', 'Vaisampayana continued,--\"The messenger coming back to the assembly told\\nall present the words of Draupadi. And he spoke unto Yudhishthira sitting\\nin the midst of the kings, these words,--Draupadi hath asked thee, Whose\\nlord wert thou at the time thou lost me in play? Didst thou lose thyself\\nfirst or me? Yudhishthira, however sat there like one demented and\\ndeprived of reason and gave no answer good or ill to the Suta.', '\"Duryodhana then said,--\\'Let the princess of Panchala come hither and put\\nher question. Let every one hear in this assembly the words that pass\\nbetween her and Yudhishthira.\\'', 'Vaisampayana continued,--\"The messenger, obedient to the command of\\nDuryodhana, going once again to the palace, himself much distressed, said\\nunto Draupadi,--\\'O princess, they that are in the assembly are summoning\\nthee. It seemeth that the end of the Kauravas is at hand. When\\nDuryodhana, O princess, is for taking thee before the assembly, this\\nweak-brained king will no longer be able to protect his prosperity.\\'', '\"Draupadi said,--\\'The great ordainer of the world hath, indeed, ordained\\nso. Happiness and misery pay their court to both the wise and unwise.\\nMorality, however, it hath been said, is the one highest object in the\\nworld. If cherished, that will certainly dispense blessings to us. Let\\nnot that morality now abandon the Kauravas. Going back to those that are\\npresent in that assembly, repeat these my words consonant with morality.\\nI am ready to do what those elderly and virtuous persons conversant with\\nmorality will definitely tell me.', 'Vaisampayana continued,--\"The Suta, hearing these words of Yajnaseni,\\ncame back to the assembly and repeated the words of Draupadi. But all sat\\nwith faces downwards, uttering not a word, knowing the eagerness and\\nresolution of Dhritarashtra\\'s son.', '\"Yudhishthira, however, O bull of the Bharata race, hearing of\\nDuryodhana\\'s intentions, sent a trusted messenger unto Draupadi,\\ndirecting that although she was attired in one piece of cloth with her\\nnavel itself exposed, in consequence of her season having come, she\\nshould come before her father-in-law weeping bitterly. And that\\nintelligent messenger, O king, having gone to Draupadi\\'s abode with\\nspeed, informed her of the intentions of Yudhishthira. The illustrious\\nPandavas, meanwhile, distressed and sorrowful, and bound by promise,\\ncould not settle what they should do. And casting his eyes upon them,\\nking Duryodhana, glad at heart, addressed the Suta and said,--\\'O\\nPratikamin, bring her hither. Let the Kauravas answer her question before\\nher face. The Suta, then, obedient to his commands, but terrified at the\\n(possible) wrath of the daughter of Drupada, disregarding his reputation\\nfor intelligence, once again said to those that were in the\\nassembly,--what shall I say unto Krishna?\\'', '\"Duryodhana, hearing this, said,--\\'O Dussasana, this son of my Suta, of\\nlittle intelligence, feareth Vrikodara. Therefore, go thou thyself and\\nforcibly bring hither the daughter of Yajnasena, Our enemies at present\\nare dependent on our will. What can they do thee?\\' Hearing the command of\\nhis brother, prince Dussasana rose with blood-red eyes, and entering the\\nabode of those great warriors, spake these words unto the princess,\\n\\'Come, come, O Krishna, princess of Panchala, thou hast been won by us.\\nAnd O thou of eyes large as lotus leaves, come now and accept the Kurus\\nfor thy lords. Thou hast been won virtuously, come to the assembly.\\' At\\nthese words, Draupadi, rising up in great affliction, rubbed her pale\\nface with her hands, and distressed she ran to the place where the ladies\\nof Dhritarashtra\\'s household were. At this, Dussasana roaring in anger,\\nran after her and seized the queen by her locks, so long and blue and\\nwavy. Alas! those locks that had been sprinkled with water sanctified\\nwith mantras in the great Rajasuya sacrifice, were now forcibly seized by\\nthe son of Dhritarashtra disregarding the prowess of the Pandavas. And\\nDussasana dragging Krishna of long long locks unto the presence of the\\nassembly--as if she were helpless though having powerful protectors--and\\npulling at her, made her tremble like the banana plant in a storm. And\\ndragged by him, with body bent, she faintly cried--\\'Wretch! it ill\\nbehoveth thee to take me before the assembly. My season hath come, and I\\nam now clad in one piece of attire. But Dussasana dragging Draupadi\\nforcibly by her black locks while she was praying piteously unto Krishna\\nand Vishnu who were Narayana and Nara (on earth), said unto her--\\'Whether\\nthy season hath come or not, whether thou art attired in one piece of\\ncloth or entirely naked, when thou hast been won at dice and made our\\nslave, thou art to live amongst our serving-women as thou pleasest.\"', 'Vaisampayana continued,--\"With hair dishevelled and half her attire\\nloosened, all the while dragged by Dussasana, the modest Krishna consumed\\nwith anger, faintly said--\"In this assembly are persons conversant with\\nall the branches of learning devoted to the performance of sacrifices and\\nother rites, and all equal unto Indra, persons some of whom are really my\\nsuperiors and others who deserve to be respected as such. I can not stay\\nbefore them in this state. O wretch! O thou of cruel deeds, drag me not\\nso. Uncover me not so. The princes (my lords) will not pardon thee, even\\nif thou hast the gods themselves with Indra as thy allies. The\\nillustrious son of Dharma is now bound by the obligations of morality.\\nMorality, however, is subtle. Those only that are possessed of great\\nclearness of vision can ascertain it. In speech even I am unwilling to\\nadmit an atom of fault in my lord forgetting his virtues. Thou draggest\\nme who am in my season before these Kuru heroes. This is truly an\\nunworthy act. But no one here rebuketh thee. Assuredly, all these are of\\nthe same mind with thee. O fie! Truly hath the virtue of the Bharata\\ngone! Truly also hath the usage of those acquainted with the Kshatriya\\npractice disappeared! Else these Kurus in this assembly would never have\\nlooked silently on this act that transgresseth the limits of their\\npractices. Oh! both Drona and Bhishma have lost their energy, and so also\\nhath the high-souled Kshatta, and so also this king. Else, why do these\\nforemost of the Kuru elders look silently on this great crime?\"', 'Vaisampayana continued,--\"Thus did Krishna of slender waist cry in\\ndistress in that assembly. And casting a glance upon her enraged\\nlords--the Pandavas--who were filled with terrible wrath, she inflamed\\nthem further with that glance of hers. And they were not so distressed at\\nhaving been robbed of their kingdom, of their wealth, of their costliest\\ngems, as with that glance of Krishna moved by modesty and anger. And\\nDussasana, beholding Krishna looking at her helpless lords, dragging her\\nstill more forcibly, and addressed her, \\'Slave, Slave\\' and laughed aloud.\\nAnd at those words Karna became very glad and approved of them by\\nlaughing aloud. And Sakuni, the son of Suvala, the Gandhara king,\\nsimilarly applauded Dussasana. And amongst all those that were in the\\nassembly except these three and Duryodhana, every one was filled with\\nsorrow at beholding Krishna thus dragged in sight of that assembly. And\\nbeholding it all, Bhishma said, \\'O blessed one, morality is subtle. I\\ntherefore am unable to duly decide this point that thou hast put,\\nbeholding that on the one hand one that hath no wealth cannot stake the\\nwealth belonging to others, while on the other hand wives are always\\nunder the orders and at the disposal of their lords. Yudhishthira can\\nabandon the whole world full of wealth, but he will never sacrifice\\nmorality. The son of Pandu hath said--\\'I am won.\\' Therefore, I am unable\\nto decide this matter. Sakuni hath not his equal among men at dice-play.\\nThe son of Kunti still voluntarily staked with him. The illustrious\\nYudhishthira doth not himself regard that Sakuni hath played with him\\ndeceitfully. Therefore, I can not decide this point.\"', '\"Draupadi said,--\"The king was summoned to this assembly and though\\npossessing no skill at dice, he was made to play with skilful, wicked,\\ndeceitful and desperate gamblers. How can he be said then to have staked\\nvoluntarily? The chief of the Pandavas was deprived of his senses by\\nwretches of deceitful conduct and unholy instincts, acting together, and\\nthen vanquished. He could not understand their tricks, but he hath now\\ndone so. Here, in this assembly, there are Kurus who are the lords of\\nboth their sons and their daughters-in-law! Let all of them, reflecting\\nwell upon my words, duly decide the point that I have put.', 'Vaisampayana continued,--\\'Unto Krishna who was thus weeping and crying\\npiteously, looking at times upon her helpless lord, Dussasana spake many\\ndisagreeable and harsh words. And beholding her who was then in her\\nseason thus dragged, and her upper garments loosened, beholding her in\\nthat condition which she little deserved, Vrikodara afflicted beyond\\nendurance, his eyes fixed upon Yudhishthira, gave way to wrath.\"', '\"Bhima said,--\\'O Yudhishthira, gamblers have in their houses many women\\nof loose character. They do not yet stake those women having kindness for\\nthem even. Whatever wealth and other excellent articles the king of Kasi\\ngave, whatever, gems, animals, wealth, coats of mail and weapons that\\nother kings of the earth gave, our kingdom, thyself and ourselves, have\\nall been won by the foes. At all this my wrath was not excited for thou\\nart our lord. This, however, I regard as a highly improper act--this act\\nof staking Draupadi. This innocent girl deserveth not this treatment.\\nHaving obtained the Pandavas as her lords, it is for thee alone that she\\nis being thus persecuted by the low, despicable, cruel, and mean-minded\\nKauravas. It is for her sake, O king, that my anger falleth on thee. I\\nshall burn those hands of thine. Sahadeva, bring some fire.\"', \"'Arjuna hearing this, said,--'Thou hast never, O Bhimasena, before this\\nuttered such words as these. Assuredly thy high morality hath been\\ndestroyed by these cruel foes. Thou shouldst not fulfil the wishes of the\\nenemy. Practise thou the highest morality. Whom doth it behave to\\ntransgress his virtuous eldest brother? The king was summoned by the foe,\\nand remembering the usage of the Kshatriyas, he played at dice against\\nhis will. That is certainly conducive to our great fame.\", '\\'Bhima said,--\\'If I had not known, O Dhananjaya, that the king had acted\\naccording to Kshatriya usage, then I would have, taking his hands\\ntogether by sheer force, burnt them in a blazing fire.\"', 'Vaisampayana continued,--\"Beholding the Pandavas thus distressed and the\\nprincess of Panchala also thus afflicted, Vikarna the son of\\nDhritarashtra said--\\'Ye kings, answer ye the question that hath been\\nasked by Yajnaseni. If we do not judge a matter referred to us, all of us\\nwill assuredly have to go to hell without delay. How is that Bhishma and\\nDhritarashtra, both of whom are the oldest of the Kurus, as also the\\nhigh-souled Vidura, do not say anything! The son of Bharadwaja who is the\\npreceptor of us, as also Kripa, is here. Why do not these best of\\nregenerate ones answer the question? Let also those other kings assembled\\nhere from all directions answer according to their judgment this\\nquestion, leaving aside all motives of gain and anger. Ye kings, answer\\nye the question that hath been asked by this blessed daughter of king\\nDrupada, and declare after reflection on which side each of ye is.\\' Thus\\ndid Vikarna repeatedly appeal to those that were in that assembly. But\\nthose kings answered him not one word, good or ill. And Vikarna having\\nrepeatedly appealed to all the kings began to rub his hands and sigh like\\na snake. And at last the prince said--\\'Ye kings of the earth, ye\\nKauravas, whether ye answer this question or not, I will say what I\\nregard as just and proper. Ye foremost of men, it hath been said that\\nhunting, drinking, gambling, and too much enjoyment of women, are the\\nfour vices of kings. The man, that is addicted to these, liveth forsaking\\nvirtue. And people do not regard the acts done by a person who is thus\\nimproperly engaged, as of any authority. This son of Pandu, while deeply\\nengaged in one of these vicious acts, urged thereto by deceitful\\ngamblers, made Draupadi a stake. The innocent Draupadi is, besides, the\\ncommon wife of all the sons of Pandu. And the king, having first lost\\nhimself offered her as a stake. And Suvala himself desirous of a stake,\\nindeed prevailed upon the king to stake this Krishna. Reflecting upon all\\nthese circumstances, I regard Draupadi as not won.\"', '\"Hearing these words, a loud uproar rose from among those present in that\\nassembly. And they all applauded Vikarna and censured the son of Suvala.\\nAnd at that sound, the son of Radha, deprived of his senses by anger,\\nwaving his well-shaped arms, said these words,--\\'O Vikarna, many opposite\\nand inconsistent conditions are noticeable in this assembly. Like fire\\nproduced from a faggot, consuming the faggot itself, this thy ire will\\nconsume thee. These personages here, though urged by Krishna, have not\\nuttered a word. They all regard the daughter of Drupada to have been\\nproperly won. Thou alone, O son of Dhritarashtra in consequence of thy\\nimmature years, art bursting with wrath, for though but a boy thou\\nspeakest in the assembly as if thou wert old. O younger brother of\\nDuryodhana, thou dost not know what morality truly is, for thou sayest\\nlike a fool that this Krishna who hath been (justly) won as not won at\\nall. O son of Dhritarashtra, how dost thou regard Krishna as not won,\\nwhen the eldest of the Pandavas before this assembly staked all his\\npossessions? O bull of the Bharata race, Draupadi is included in all the\\npossessions (of Yudhishthira). Therefore, why regardest thou Krishna who\\nhath been justly won as not won? Draupadi had been mentioned (by Suvala)\\nand approved of as a stake by the Pandavas. For what reason then dost\\nthou yet regard her as not won? Or, if thou thinkest that bringing her\\nhither attired in a single piece of cloth, is an action of impropriety,\\nlisten to certain excellent reasons I will give. O son of the Kuru race,\\nthe gods have ordained only one husband for one woman. This Draupadi,\\nhowever, hath many husbands. Therefore, certain it is that she is an\\nunchaste woman. To bring her, therefore, into this assembly attired\\nthough she be in one piece of cloth--even to uncover her is not at all an\\nact that may cause surprise. Whatever wealth the Pandavas had--she\\nherself and these Pandavas themselves,--have all been justly won by the\\nson of Suvala. O Dussasana, this Vikarna speaking words of (apparent)\\nwisdom is but a boy. Take off the robes of the Pandavas as also the\\nattire of Draupadi. Hearing these words the Pandavas, O Bharata, took of\\ntheir upper garments and throwing them down sat in that assembly. Then\\nDussasana, O king, forcibly seizing Draupadi\\'s attire before the eyes of\\nall, began to drag it off her person.\"', 'Vaisampayana continued,--\"When the attire of Draupadi was being thus\\ndragged, the thought of Hari, (And she herself cried aloud, saying), \\'O\\nGovinda, O thou who dwellest in Dwaraka, O Krishna, O thou who art fond\\nof cow-herdesses (of Vrindavana). O Kesava, seest thou not that the\\nKauravas are humiliating me. O Lord, O husband of Lakshmi, O Lord of\\nVraja (Vrindavana), O destroyer of all afflictions, O Janarddana, rescue\\nme who am sinking in the Kaurava Ocean. O Krishna, O Krishna, O thou\\ngreat yogin, thou soul of the universe, Thou creator of all things, O\\nGovinda, save me who am distressed,--who am losing my senses in the midst\\nof the Kurus.\\' Thus did that afflicted lady resplendent still in her\\nbeauty, O king covering her face cried aloud, thinking of Krishna, of\\nHari, of the lord of the three worlds. Hearing the words of Draupadi,\\nKrishna was deeply moved. And leaving his seat, the benevolent one from\\ncompassion, arrived there on foot. And while Yajnaseni was crying aloud\\nto Krishna, also called Vishnu and Hari and Nara for protection, the\\nillustrious Dharma, remaining unseen, covered her with excellent clothes\\nof many hues. And, O monarch as the attire of Draupadi was being dragged,\\nafter one was taken off, another of the same kind, appeared covering her.\\nAnd thus did it continue till many clothes were seen. And, O exalted on,\\nowing to the protection of Dharma, hundreds upon hundreds of robes of\\nmany hues came off Draupadi\\'s person. And there arose then a deep uproar\\nof many many voices. And the kings present in that assembly beholding\\nthat most extraordinary of all sights in the world, began to applaud\\nDraupadi and censure the son of Dhritarashtra. And Bhima then, squeezing\\nhis hands, with lips quivering in rage, swore in the midst of all those\\nkings a terrible oath in a loud voice.', '\"And Bhima said,--Hear these words of mine, ye Kshatriyas of the world.\\nWords such as these were never before uttered by other men, nor will\\nanybody in the future ever utter them. Ye lords of earth, if having\\nspoken these words I do not accomplish them hereafter, let me not obtain\\nthe region of my deceased ancestors. Tearing open in battle, by sheer\\nforce, the breast of this wretch, this wicked-minded scoundrel of the\\nBharata race, if I do not drink his life-blood, let me not obtain the\\nregion of my ancestors.\"', 'Vaisampayana continued,--\"Hearing these terrible words of Bhima that made\\nthe down of the auditors to stand on end, everybody present there\\napplauded him and censured the son of Dhritarashtra. And when a mass of\\nclothes had been gathered in that assembly, all dragged from the person\\nof Draupadi, Dussasana, tired and ashamed, sat down. And beholding the\\nsons of Kunti in that state, the persons--those gods among men--that were\\nin that assembly all uttered the word \\'Fie!\\'(on the son of\\nDhritarashtra). And the united voices of all became so loud that they\\nmade the down of anybody who heard them stand on end. And all the honest\\nmen that were in that assembly began to say,--\\'Alas! the Kauravas answer\\nnot the question that hath been put to them by Draupadi. And all\\ncensuring Dhritarashtra together, made a loud clamour. Then Vidura, that\\nmaster of the science of morality, waving his hands and silencing every\\none, spake these words;--\\'Ye that are in this assembly, Draupadi having\\nput her question is weeping helplessly. Ye are not answering her. Virtue\\nand morality are being persecuted by such conduct. An afflicted person\\napproacheth an assembly of good men, like one that is being consumed by\\nfire. They that are in the assembly quench that fire and cool him by\\nmeans of truth and morality. The afflicted person asketh the assembly\\nabout his rights, as sanctioned by morality. They that are in the\\nassembly should, unmoved by interest and anger, answer the question. Ye\\nkings, Vikarna hath answered the question, according to his own knowledge\\nand judgment. Ye should also answer it as ye think proper. Knowing the\\nrules of morality, and having attended an assembly, he that doth not\\nanswer a query that is put, incurreth half the demerit that attacheth to\\na lie. He, on the other hand, who, knowing the rules of morality and\\nhaving joined an assembly answereth falsely, assuredly incurreth the sin\\nof a lie. The learned quote as an example in this connection the old\\nhistory of Prahlada and the son of Angirasa.', '\"There was of old a chief of the Daityas of the name Prahlada. He had a\\nson named Virochana. And Virochana, for the sake of obtaining a bride,\\nquarrelled with Sudhanwan, the son of Angiras. It hath been heard by us\\nthat they mutually wagered their lives, saying--I am superior,--I am\\nsuperior,--for the sake of obtaining a bride. And after they had thus\\nquarrelled with each other, they both made Prahlada the arbitrator to\\ndecide between them. And they asked him, saying;--Who amongst us is\\nsuperior (to the other)? Answer this question. Speak not falsely.\\nFrightened at this quarrel, Prahlada cast his eyes upon Sudhanwan. And\\nSudhanwan in rage, burning like unto the mace of Yama, told him,--If thou\\nanswerest falsely, or dost not answer at all thy head will then be split\\ninto a hundred pieces by the wielder of the thunderbolt with that bolt of\\nhis.--Thus addressed by Sudhanwan, the Daitya, trembling like a leaf of\\nthe fig tree, went to Kasyapa of great energy, for taking counsel with\\nhim. And Prahlada said,--\\'Thou art, O illustrious and exalted one, fully\\nconversant with the rules of morality that should guide both the gods and\\nthe Asuras and the Brahmanas as well. Here, however, is a situation of\\ngreat difficulty in respect of duty. Tell me, I ask thee, what regions\\nare obtainable by them who upon being asked a question, answer it not, or\\nanswer it falsely. Kasyapa thus asked answered.--\\'He that knoweth, but\\nanswereth not a question from temptation, anger or fear, casteth upon\\nhimself a thousand nooses of Varuna. And the person who, cited as a\\nwitness with respect to any matter of ocular or auricular knowledge,\\nspeaketh carelessly, casteth a thousand nooses of Varuna upon his own\\nperson. On the completion of one full year, one such noose is loosened.\\nTherefore, he that knoweth, should speak the truth without concealment.\\nIf virtue, pierced by sin, repaireth to an assembly (for aid), it is the\\nduty of every body in the assembly to take off the dart, otherwise they\\nthemselves would be pierced with it. In an assembly where a truly\\ncensurable act is not rebuked, half the demerit of that act attacheth to\\nthe head of that assembly, a fourth to the person acting censurably and a\\nfourth unto those others that are there. In that assembly, on the other\\nhand, when he that deserveth censure is rebuked, the head of the assembly\\nbecometh freed from all sins, and the other members also incur none. It\\nis only the perpetrator himself of the act that becometh responsible for\\nit. O Prahlada, they who answer falsely those that ask them about\\nmorality destroy the meritorious acts of their seven upper and seven\\nlower generations. The grief of one who hath lost all his wealth, of one\\nwho hath lost a son, of one who is in debt, of one who is separated from\\nhis companions, of a woman who hath lost her husband, of one that hath\\nlost his all in consequence of the king\\'s demand, of a woman who is\\nsterile, of one who hath been devoured by a tiger (during his last\\nstruggles in the tiger\\'s claws), of one who is a co-wife, and of one who\\nhath been deprived of his property by false witnesses, have been said by\\nthe gods to be uniform in degree. These different sorts of grief are his\\nwho speaketh false. A person becometh a witness in consequence of his\\nhaving seen, heard, and understood a thing. Therefore, a witness should\\nalways tell the truth. A truth-telling witness never loseth his religious\\nmerits and earthly possessions also.\\' Hearing these words of Kasyapa,\\nPrahlada told his son, \"Sudhanwan is superior to thee, as indeed, (his\\nfather) Angiras is superior to me. The mother also of Sudhanwan is\\nsuperior to thy mother. Therefore, O Virochana, this Sudhanwan is now the\\nlord of the life.\" At these words of Prahlada, Sudhanwan said, \"Since\\nunmoved by affection for thy child, thou hast adhered to virtue, I\\ncommand, let this son of thine live for a hundred years.\"', '\"Vidura continued,--Let all the persons, therefore, present in this\\nassembly hearing these high truths of morality, reflect upon what should\\nbe the answer to the question asked by Draupadi\".', 'Vaisampayana continued,--\"The kings that were there hearing these words\\nof Vidura, answered not a word, yet Karna alone spoke unto Dussasana,\\ntelling him. Take away this serving-woman Krishna into the inner\\napartments. And thereupon Dussasana began to drag before all the\\nspectators the helpless and modest Draupadi, trembling and crying\\npiteously unto the Pandavas her lords.\"', '', 'Draupadi said,--\\'Wait a little, thou worst of men, thou wicked-minded\\nDussasana. I have an act to perform--a high duty that hath not been\\nperformed by me yet. Dragged forcibly by this wretch\\'s strong arms, I was\\ndeprived of my senses. I salute these reverend seniors in this assembly\\nof the Kurus. That I could not do this before cannot be my fault.\\'\"', 'Vaisampayana said,--\"Dragged with greater force than before, the\\nafflicted and helpless Draupadi, undeserving of such treatment, falling\\ndown upon the ground, thus wept in that assembly of the Kurus,--', '\"\\'Alas, only once before, on the occasion of the Swayamvara, I was beheld\\nby the assembled kings in the amphitheatre, and never even once beheld\\nafterwards. I am to-day brought before this assembly. She whom even the\\nwinds and the sun had seen never before in her palace is to-day before\\nthis assembly and exposed to the gaze of the crowd. Alas, she whom the\\nsons of Pandu could not, while in her palace, suffer to be touched even\\nby the wind, is to-day suffered by the Pandavas to be seized and dragged\\nby this wretch. Alas, these Kauravas also suffer their daughter-in-law,\\nso unworthy of such treatment, to be thus afflicted before them. It\\nseemeth that the times are out of joint. What can be more distressing to\\nme, than that though high-born and chaste, I should yet be compelled to\\nenter this public court? Where is that virtue for which these kings were\\nnoted? It hath been heard that the kings of ancient days never brought\\ntheir wedded wives into the public court. Alas, that eternal usage hath\\ndisappeared from among the Kauravas. Else, how is it that the chaste wife\\nof the Pandavas, the sister of Prishata\\'s son, the friend of Vasudeva, is\\nbrought before this assembly? Ye Kauravas, I am the wedded wife of king\\nYudhishthira the just, hailing from the same dynasty to which the King\\nbelonged. Tell me now if I am a serving-maid or otherwise. I will\\ncheerfully accept your answer. This mean wretch, this destroyer of the\\nname of the Kurus, is afflicting me hard. Ye Kauravas, I cannot bear it\\nany longer. Ye kings, I desire ye to answer whether ye regard me as won\\nor unwon. I will accept your verdict whatever it be.\\'', '\"Hearing these words, Bhishma answered, I have already said, O blessed\\none that the course of morality is subtle. Even the illustrious wise in\\nthis world fail to understand it always. What in this world a strong man\\ncalls morality is regarded as such by others, however otherwise it may\\nreally be; but what a weak man calls morality is scarcely regarded as\\nsuch even if it be the highest morality. From the importance of the issue\\ninvolved, from its intricacy and subtlety, I am unable to answer with\\ncertitude the question thou hast asked. However, it is certain that as\\nall the Kurus have become the slaves of covetousness and folly, the\\ndestruction of this our race will happen on no distant date. O blessed\\none, the family into which thou hast been admitted as a daughter-in-law,\\nis such that those who are born in it, however much they might be\\nafflicted by calamities, never deviate from the paths of virtue and\\nmorality. O Princess of Panchala, this conduct of thine also, viz. that\\nthough sunk in distress, thou still easiest thy eyes on virtue and\\nmorality, is assuredly worthy of thee. These persons, Drona and others,\\nof mature years and conversant with morality, sit heads downwards like\\nmen that are dead, with bodies from which life hath departed. It seemeth\\nto me, however, that Yudhishthira is an authority on this question. It\\nbehoveth him to declare whether thou art won or not won.\"', '', 'Vaisampayana said,--\"The kings present in that assembly, from tear of\\nDuryodhana, uttered not a word, good or ill, although they beheld\\nDraupadi crying piteously in affliction like a female osprey, and\\nrepeatedly appealing to them. And the son of Dhritarashtra beholding\\nthose kings and sons and grand sons of kings all remaining silent, smiled\\na little, and addressing the daughter of the king of Panchala, said,--O\\nYajnaseni, the question thou hast put dependeth on thy husbands--on Bhima\\nof mighty strength, on Arjuna, on Nakula, on Sahadeva. Let them answer\\nthy question. O Panchali, let them for thy sake declare in the midst of\\nthese respectable men that Yudhishthira is not their lord, let them\\nthereby make king Yudhishthira the just a liar. Thou shalt then be freed\\nfrom the condition of slavery. Let the illustrious son of Dharma, always\\nadhering to virtue, who is even like Indra, himself declare whether he is\\nnot thy lord. At his words, accept thou the Pandavas or ourselves without\\ndelay. Indeed, all the Kauravas present in this assembly are floating in\\nthe ocean of thy distress. Endued with magnanimity, they are unable to\\nanswer thy question, looking at thy unfortunate husbands.\\'\"', 'Vaisampayana continued,--\"Hearing these words of the Kuru king, all who\\nwere present in the assembly loudly applauded them. And shouting\\napprovingly, they made signs unto one another by motions of their eyes\\nand lips. And amongst some that were there, sounds of distress such as\\n\\'O! and \\'Alas!\" were heard. And at these words of Duryodhana, so\\ndelightful (to his partisans), the Kauravas present in that assembly\\nbecame exceedingly glad. And the kings, with faces turned sideways,\\nlooked upon Yudhishthira conversant with the rules of morality, curious\\nto hear what he would say. And every one present in that assembly became\\ncurious to hear what Arjuna, the son of Pandu never defeated in battle,\\nand what Bhimasena, and what the twins also would say. And when that busy\\nhum of many voices became still, Bhimasena, waving his strong and\\nwell-formed arms smeared with sandalpaste spake these words,--\\'If this\\nhigh-souled king Yudhishthira the just, who is our eldest brother, had\\nnot been our lord, we would never have forgiven the Kuru race (for all\\nthis). He is the lord of all our religious and ascetic merits, the lord\\nof even our lives. If he regardeth himself as won, we too have all been\\nwon. If this were not so, who is there amongst creatures touching the\\nearth with their feet and mortal, that would escape from me with his life\\nafter having touched those locks of the princess of Panchala? Behold\\nthese mighty, well-formed arms of mine, even like maces of iron. Having\\nonce come within them, even he of a hundred sacrifices is incapable of\\neffecting an escape. Bound by the ties of virtue and the reverence that\\nis due to our eldest brother, and repeatedly urged by Arjuna to remain\\nsilent, I am not doing anything terrible. If however, I am once commanded\\nby king Yudhishthira the just, I would slay these wretched sons of\\nDhritarashtra, making slaps do the work of swords, like a lion slaying a\\nnumber of little animals.\"', 'Vaisampayana continued,--\"Unto Bhima who had spoken these words Bhishma\\nand Drona and Vidura said, \\'Forbear, O Bhima. Everything is possible with\\nthee.\\'\"', '', '\"Karna said,--\\'Of all the persons in the assembly, three, viz., Bhishma,\\nVidura, and the preceptor of the Kurus (Drona) appear to be independent;\\nfor they always speak of their master as wicked, always censure him, and\\nnever wish for his prosperity. O excellent one, the slave, the son, and\\nthe wife are always dependent. They cannot earn wealth, for whatever they\\nearn belongeth to their master. Thou art the wife of a slave incapable of\\npossessing anything on his own account. Repair now to the inner\\napartments of king Dhritarashtra and serve the king\\'s relatives. We\\ndirect that that is now thy proper business. And, O princess, all the\\nsons of Dhritarashtra and not the sons of Pritha are now thy masters. O\\nhandsome one, select thou another husband now,--one who will not make\\nthee a slave by gambling. It is well-known that women, especially that\\nare slaves, are not censurable if they proceed with freedom in electing\\nhusbands. Therefore let it be done by thee. Nakula hath been won, as also\\nBhimasena, and Yudhishthira also, and Sahadeva, and Arjuna. And, O\\nYajnaseni, thou art now a slave. Thy husbands that are slaves cannot\\ncontinue to be thy lords any longer. Alas, doth not the son of Pritha\\nregards life, prowess and manhood as of no use that he offereth this\\ndaughter of Drupada, the king of Panchala, in the presence of all this\\nassembly, as a stake at dice?\\'\"', 'Vaisampayana continued,--\"Hearing these words, the wrathful Bhima\\nbreathed hard, a very picture of woe. Obedient to the king and bound by\\nthe tie of virtue and duty, burning everything with his eyes inflamed by\\nanger, he said,--\\'O king, I cannot be angry at these words of this son of\\na Suta, for we have truly entered the state of servitude. But O king,\\ncould our enemies have said so unto me, it thou hadst not played staking\\nthis princess?\\'\"', 'Vaisampayana continued,--\"Hearing these words of Bhimasena king\\nDuryodhana addressed Yudhishthira who was silent and deprived of his\\nsenses, saying,--\\'O king, both Bhima and Arjuna, and the twins also, are\\nunder thy sway. Answer thou the question (that hath been asked by\\nDraupadi). Say, whether thou regardest Krishna as unwon.\\' And having\\nspoken thus unto the son of Kunti, Duryodhana. desirous of encouraging\\nthe son of Radha and insulting Bhima, quickly uncovered his left thigh\\nthat was like unto the stem of a plantain tree or the trunk of an\\nelephant and which was graced with every auspicious sign and endued with\\nthe strength of thunder, and showed it to Draupadi in her very sight. And\\nbeholding this, Bhimasena expanding his red eyes, said unto Duryodhana in\\nthe midst of all those kings and as if piercing them (with his dart-like\\nwords),--\\'Let not Vrikodara attain to the regions, obtained by his\\nancestors, if he doth not break that thigh of thine in the great\\nconflict. And sparkles of fire began to be emitted from every organ of\\nsense of Bhima filled with wrath, like those that come out of every crack\\nand orifice in the body of a blazing tree.', \"Vidura then, addressing everybody, said,--'Ye kings of Pratipa's race,\\nbehold the great danger that ariseth from Bhimasena. Know ye for certain\\nthat this great calamity that threatens to overtake the Bharatas hath\\nbeen sent by Destiny itself. The sons of Dhritarashtra have, indeed,\\ngambled disregarding every proper consideration. They are even now\\ndisputing in this assembly about a lady (of the royal household). The\\nprosperity of our kingdom is at an end. Alas, the Kauravas are even now\\nengaged in sinful consultations. Ye Kauravas, take to your heart this\\nhigh precept that I declare. If virtue is persecuted, the whole assembly\\nbecometh polluted. If Yudhishthira had staked her before he was himself\\nwon, he would certainly have been regarded as her master. If, however a\\nperson staketh anything at a time when he himself is incapable of holding\\nany wealth, to win it is very like obtaining wealth in a dream. Listening\\nto the words of the king of Gandhara, fall ye not off from this undoubted\\ntruth.'\", '\"Duryodhana, hearing Vidura thus speak, said,--\\'I am willing to abide by\\nthe words of Bhima, of Arjuna and of the twins. Let them say that\\nYudhishthira is not their master. Yajnaseni will then be freed from her\\nstate of bondage.\"', '\"Arjuna at this, said,--\"This illustrious son of Kunti, king Yudhishthira\\nthe just, was certainly our master before he began to play. But having\\nlost himself, let all the Kauravas judge whose master he could be after\\nthat.\"', 'Vaisampayana continued,--\"Just then, a jackal began to cry loudly in the\\nhoma-chamber of king Dhritarashtra\\'s palace. And, O king, unto the jackal\\nthat howled so, the asses began to bray responsively. And terrible birds\\nalso, from all sides, began to answer with their cries. And Vidura\\nconversant with everything and the daughter of Suvala, both understood\\nthe meaning of those terrible sounds. And Bhishma and Drona and the\\nlearned Gautama loudly cried,--Swashti! Swashti![1] Then Gandhari and the\\nlearned Vidura beholding that frightful omen, represented everything, in\\ngreat affliction, unto the king. And the king (Dhritarashtra) thereupon\\nsaid,--', \"'Thou wicked-minded Duryodhana, thou wretch, destruction hath all ready\\novertaken thee when thou insultest in language such as this the wife of\\nthese bulls among the Kurus, especially their wedded wife Draupadi. And\\nhaving spoken those words, the wise Dhritarashtra endued with knowledge,\\nreflecting with the aid of his wisdom and desirous of saving his\\nrelatives and friends from destruction, began to console Krishna, the\\nprincess of Panchala, and addressing her, the monarch said,--'Ask of me\\nany boon, O princess of Panchala, that thou desirest, Chaste and devoted\\nto virtue, thou art the first of all my daughters-in-law.\", '\"Draupadi said,--\\'O bull of the Bharata race, if thou will grant me a\\nboon, I ask the handsome Yudhishthira, obedient to every duty, be freed\\nfrom slavery. Let not unthinking children call my child Prativindhya\\nendued with great energy of mind as the son of a slave. Having been a\\nprince, so superior to all men, and nurtured by kings it is not proper\\nthat he should be called the child of a slave.', '\"Dhritarashtra said unto her,--\\'O auspicious one, let it be as thou\\nsayest. O excellent one, ask thou another boon, for I will give it. My\\nheart inclineth to give thee a second boon. Thou dost not deserve only\\none boon.', '\"Draupadi said,--\\'I ask, O king, that Bhimasena and Dhananjaya and the\\ntwins also, with their cars and bows, freed from bondage, regain their\\nliberty.\\'', \"'Dhritarashtra said,--'O blessed daughter, let it be as thou desirest.\\nAsk thou a third boon, for thou hast not been sufficiently honoured with\\ntwo boons. Virtuous in thy behaviour, thou art the foremost of all my\\ndaughters-in-law.\", 'Draupadi said,--\\'O best of kings, O illustrious one, covetousness always\\nbringeth about loss of virtue. I do not deserve a third boon. Therefore I\\ndare not ask any. O king of kings, it hath been said that a Vaisya may\\nask one boon; a Kshatriya lady, two boons; a Kshatriya male, three, and a\\nBrahmana, a hundred. O king, these my husbands freed from the wretched\\nstate of bondage, will be able to achieve prosperity by their own\\nvirtuous acts!\\'\"', '', '\"Karna said,--\\'We have never heard of such an act (as this one of\\nDraupadi), performed by any of the women noted in this world for their\\nbeauty. When the sons of both Pandu and Dhritarashtra were excited with\\nwrath, this Draupadi became unto the sons of Pandu as their salvation.\\nIndeed the princess of Panchala, becoming as a boat unto the sons of\\nPandu who were sinking in a boatless ocean of distress, hath brought them\\nin safety to the shore.\\'\"', 'Vaisampayana continued,--\"Hearing these words of Karna in the midst of\\nthe Kurus,--viz., that the sons of Pandu were saved by their wife,--the\\nangry Bhimasena in great affliction said (unto Arjuna),--\\'O Dhananjaya,\\nit hath been said by Devala three lights reside in every person, viz.,\\noffspring, acts and learning, for from these three hath sprung creation.\\nWhen life becometh extinct and the body becometh impure and is cast off\\nby relatives, these three become of service to every person. But the\\nlight that is in us hath been dimmed by this act of insult to our wife.\\nHow, O Arjuna, can a son born from this insulted wife of ours prove\\nserviceable to us?', '\"Arjuna replied,--\\'Superior persons, O Bharata, never prate about the\\nharsh words that may or may not be uttered by inferior men. Persons that\\nhave earned respect for themselves, even if they are able to retaliate,\\nremember not the acts of hostility done by their enemies, but, on the\\nother hand, treasure up only their good deeds.\\'', '\\'Bhima said,--\\'Shall I, O king, slay, without loss of time all these foes\\nassembled together, even here, or shall I destroy them, O Bharata, by the\\nroots, outside this palace? Or, what need is there of words or of\\ncommand? I shall slay all these even now, and rule thou the whole earth,\\nO king, without a rival. And saying this, Bhima with his younger\\nbrothers, like a lion in the midst of a herd of inferior animals,\\nrepeatedly cast his angry glances around. But Arjuna, however, of white\\ndeeds, with appealing looks began to pacify his elder brother. And the\\nmighty-armed hero endued with great prowess began to burn with the fire\\nof his wrath. And, O king, this fire began to issue out of Vrikodara\\'s\\nears and other senses with smoke and sparks and flames. And his face\\nbecame terrible to behold in consequence of his furrowed brows like those\\nof Yama himself at the time of the universal destruction. Then\\nYudhishthira forbade the mighty hero, embracing him with his arms and\\ntelling him \\'Be not so. Stay in silence and peace.\\' And having pacified\\nthe mighty-armed one with eyes red in wrath, the king approached his\\nuncle Dhritarashtra, with hands joined in entreaty.\"', '', '\"Yudhishthira said,--\\'O king, thou art our master. Command us as to what\\nwe shall do. O Bharata, we desire to remain always in obedience to thee.', '\"Dhritarashtra replied.--\\'O Ajatasatru, blest be thou. Go thou in peace\\nand safety. Commanded by me, go, rule thy own kingdom with thy wealth.\\nAnd, O child, take to heart this command of an old man, this wholesome\\nadvice that I give, and which is even a nutritive regimen. O\\nYudhishthira, O child, thou knowest the subtle path of morality.\\nPossessed of great wisdom, thou art also humble, and thou waitest also\\nupon the old. Where there is intelligence, there is forbearance.\\nTherefore, O Bharata, follow thou counsels of peace. The axe falleth upon\\nwood, not upon stone. (Thou art open to advice, not Duryodhana). They are\\nthe best of men that remember not the acts of hostility of their foes;\\nthat behold only the merits, not the faults, of their enemies; and that\\nnever enter into hostilities themselves. They that are good remember only\\nthe good deeds of their foes and not the hostile acts their foes might\\nhave done unto them. The good, besides, do good unto others without\\nexpectation of any good, in return. O Yudhishthira, it is only the worst\\nof men that utter harsh words in quarrelling; while they that are\\nindifferent reply to such when spoken by others. But they that are good\\nand wise never think of or recapitulate such harsh words, little caring\\nwhether these may or may not have been uttered by their foes. They that\\nare good, having regard to the state of their own feelings, can\\nunderstand the feelings of others, and therefore remember only the good\\ndeeds and not the acts of hostility of their foes. Thou hast acted even\\nas good men of prepossessing countenance do, who transgress not the\\nlimits of virtue, wealth, pleasure and salvation. O child, remember not\\nthe harsh words of Duryodhana. Look at thy mother Gandhari and myself\\nalso, if thou desirest to remember only what is good. O Bharata, look at\\nme, who am thy father unto you and am old and blind, and still alive. It\\nwas for seeing our friends and examining also the strength and weakness\\nof my children, that I had, from motives of policy, suffered this match\\nat dice to proceed. O king those amongst the Kurus that have thee for\\ntheir ruler, and the intelligent Vidura conversant with every branch of\\nlearning for their counsellor, have, indeed, nothing to grieve for. In\\nthee is virtue, in Arjuna is patience, in Bhimasena is prowess, and the\\ntwins, those foremost of men, is pure reverence for superiors. Blest be\\nthou, O Ajatasatru.

Let thy heart also be ever fixed on\\nvirtue.\\'\"', 'Vaisampayana continued,--\"That foremost of the Bharatas--king\\nYudhishthira the just--then, thus addressed by his uncle, having gone\\nthrough every ceremony of politeness, set out with his brothers for\\nKhandavaprastha.

Snakes of deadly\\nvenom, provoked to ire, are on thy head! Wretch, do not further provoke\\nthem lest thou goest to the region of Yama. In my judgement, slavery does\\nnot attach to Krishna, in as much as she was staked by the King after he\\nhad lost himself and ceased to be his own master. Like the bamboo that\\nbeareth fruit only when it is about to die, the son of Dhritarashtra\\nwinneth this treasure at play. Intoxicated, he perceiveth nor in these\\nhis last moments that dice bring about enmity and frightful terrors. No\\nman should utter harsh speeches and pierce the hearts of the others. No\\nman should subjugate his enemies by dice and such other foul means. No\\none should utter such words as are disapproved by the Vedas and lead to\\nhell and annoy others. Some one uttereth from his lips words that are\\nharsh. Stung by them another burneth day and night. These words pierce\\nthe very heart of another. The learned, therefore, should never utter\\nthem, pointing them at others. A goat had once swallowed a hook, and when\\nit was pierced with it, the hunter placing the head of the animal on the\\nground tore its throat frightfully in drawing it out. Therefore, O\\nDuryodhana, swallow not the wealth of the Pandavas. Make them not thy\\nenemies. The sons of Pritha never use words such as these. It is only low\\nmen that are like dogs who use harsh words towards all classes of people,\\nviz., those that have retired to the woods, those leading domestic lives,\\nthose employed in ascetic devotions and those that are of great learning.\\nAlas! the son of Dhritarashtra knoweth not that dishonesty is one of the\\nfrightful doors of hell. Alas! many of the Kurus with Dussasana amongst\\nthem have followed him in the path of dishonesty in the matter of this\\nplay at dice. Even gourds may sink and stones may float, and boats also\\nmay always sink in water, still this foolish king, the son of\\nDhritarashtra, listeneth not to my words that are even as regimen unto\\nhim. Without doubt, he will be the cause of the destruction of the Kurus.\\nWhen the words of wisdom spoken by friends and which are even as fit\\nregimen are not listened to, but on the other hand temptation is on the\\nincrease, a frightful and universal destruction is sure to overtake all\\nthe Kurus.\"', '', 'Vaisampayana said,--\"Intoxicated with pride, the son of Dhritarashtra\\nspake,--\\'Fie on Kshatta! and casting his eyes upon the Pratikamin in\\nattendance, commanded him, in the midst of all those reverend seniors,\\nsaying,--\\'Go Pratikamin, and bring thou Draupadi hither.

Thou hast been won virtuously, come to the assembly.\\' At\\nthese words, Draupadi, rising up in great affliction, rubbed her pale\\nface with her hands, and distressed she ran to the place where the ladies\\nof Dhritarashtra\\'s household were. At this, Dussasana roaring in anger,\\nran after her and seized the queen by her locks, so long and blue and\\nwavy. Alas! those locks that had been sprinkled with water sanctified\\nwith mantras in the great Rajasuya sacrifice, were now forcibly seized by\\nthe son of Dhritarashtra disregarding the prowess of the Pandavas. And\\nDussasana dragging Krishna of long long locks unto the presence of the\\nassembly--as if she were helpless though having powerful protectors--and\\npulling at her, made her tremble like the banana plant in a storm. And\\ndragged by him, with body bent, she faintly cried--\\'Wretch! it ill\\nbehoveth thee to take me before the assembly. My season hath come, and I\\nam now clad in one piece of attire. But Dussasana dragging Draupadi\\nforcibly by her black locks while she was praying piteously unto Krishna\\nand Vishnu who were Narayana and Nara (on earth), said unto her--\\'Whether\\nthy season hath come or not, whether thou art attired in one piece of\\ncloth or entirely naked, when thou hast been won at dice and made our\\nslave, thou art to live amongst our serving-women as thou pleasest.\"', 'Vaisampayana continued,--\"With hair dishevelled and half her attire\\nloosened, all the while dragged by Dussasana, the modest Krishna consumed\\nwith anger, faintly said--\"In this assembly are persons conversant with\\nall the branches of learning devoted to the performance of sacrifices and\\nother rites, and all equal unto Indra, persons some of whom are really my\\nsuperiors and others who deserve to be respected as such.

And\\nDussasana, beholding Krishna looking at her helpless lords, dragging her\\nstill more forcibly, and addressed her, \\'Slave, Slave\\' and laughed aloud.\\nAnd at those words Karna became very glad and approved of them by\\nlaughing aloud. And Sakuni, the son of Suvala, the Gandhara king,\\nsimilarly applauded Dussasana. And amongst all those that were in the\\nassembly except these three and Duryodhana, every one was filled with\\nsorrow at beholding Krishna thus dragged in sight of that assembly.

I\\ntherefore am unable to duly decide this point that thou hast put,\\nbeholding that on the one hand one that hath no wealth cannot stake the\\nwealth belonging to others, while on the other hand wives are always\\nunder the orders and at the disposal of their lords. Yudhishthira can\\nabandon the whole world full of wealth, but he will never sacrifice\\nmorality. The son of Pandu hath said--\\'I am won.\\' Therefore, I am unable\\nto decide this matter. Sakuni hath not his equal among men at dice-play.\\nThe son of Kunti still voluntarily staked with him.

The son of Bharadwaja who is the\\npreceptor of us, as also Kripa, is here. Why do not these best of\\nregenerate ones answer the question? Let also those other kings assembled\\nhere from all directions answer according to their judgment this\\nquestion, leaving aside all motives of gain and anger. Ye kings, answer\\nye the question that hath been asked by this blessed daughter of king\\nDrupada, and declare after reflection on which side each of ye is.\\' Thus\\ndid Vikarna repeatedly appeal to those that were in that assembly. But\\nthose kings answered him not one word, good or ill. And Vikarna having\\nrepeatedly appealed to all the kings began to rub his hands and sigh like\\na snake. And at last the prince said--\\'Ye kings of the earth, ye\\nKauravas, whether ye answer this question or not, I will say what I\\nregard as just and proper. Ye foremost of men, it hath been said that\\nhunting, drinking, gambling, and too much enjoyment of women, are the\\nfour vices of kings. The man, that is addicted to these, liveth forsaking\\nvirtue. And people do not regard the acts done by a person who is thus\\nimproperly engaged, as of any authority. This son of Pandu, while deeply\\nengaged in one of these vicious acts, urged thereto by deceitful\\ngamblers, made Draupadi a stake. The innocent Draupadi is, besides, the\\ncommon wife of all the sons of Pandu. And the king, having first lost\\nhimself offered her as a stake. And Suvala himself desirous of a stake,\\nindeed prevailed upon the king to stake this Krishna. Reflecting upon all\\nthese circumstances, I regard Draupadi as not won.\"', '\"Hearing these words, a loud uproar rose from among those present in that\\nassembly. And they all applauded Vikarna and censured the son of Suvala.\\nAnd at that sound, the son of Radha, deprived of his senses by anger,\\nwaving his well-shaped arms, said these words,--\\'O Vikarna, many opposite\\nand inconsistent conditions are noticeable in this assembly. Like fire\\nproduced from a faggot, consuming the faggot itself, this thy ire will\\nconsume thee. These personages here, though urged by Krishna, have not\\nuttered a word. They all regard the daughter of Drupada to have been\\nproperly won. Thou alone, O son of Dhritarashtra in consequence of thy\\nimmature years, art bursting with wrath, for though but a boy thou\\nspeakest in the assembly as if thou wert old. O younger brother of\\nDuryodhana, thou dost not know what morality truly is, for thou sayest\\nlike a fool that this Krishna who hath been (justly) won as not won at\\nall. O son of Dhritarashtra, how dost thou regard Krishna as not won,\\nwhen the eldest of the Pandavas before this assembly staked all his\\npossessions? O bull of the Bharata race, Draupadi is included in all the\\npossessions (of Yudhishthira). Therefore, why regardest thou Krishna who\\nhath been justly won as not won? Draupadi had been mentioned (by Suvala)\\nand approved of as a stake by the Pandavas. For what reason then dost\\nthou yet regard her as not won? Or, if thou thinkest that bringing her\\nhither attired in a single piece of cloth, is an action of impropriety,\\nlisten to certain excellent reasons I will give. O son of the Kuru race,\\nthe gods have ordained only one husband for one woman. This Draupadi,\\nhowever, hath many husbands. Therefore, certain it is that she is an\\nunchaste woman. To bring her, therefore, into this assembly attired\\nthough she be in one piece of cloth--even to uncover her is not at all an\\nact that may cause surprise. Whatever wealth the Pandavas had--she\\nherself and these Pandavas themselves,--have all been justly won by the\\nson of Suvala. O Dussasana, this Vikarna speaking words of (apparent)\\nwisdom is but a boy. Take off the robes of the Pandavas as also the\\nattire of Draupadi. Hearing these words the Pandavas, O Bharata, took of\\ntheir upper garments and throwing them down sat in that assembly. Then\\nDussasana, O king, forcibly seizing Draupadi\\'s attire before the eyes of\\nall, began to drag it off her person.\"', 'Vaisampayana continued,--\"When the attire of Draupadi was being thus\\ndragged, the thought of Hari, (And she herself cried aloud, saying), \\'O\\nGovinda, O thou who dwellest in Dwaraka, O Krishna, O thou who art fond\\nof cow-herdesses (of Vrindavana). O Kesava, seest thou not that the\\nKauravas are humiliating me. O Lord, O husband of Lakshmi, O Lord of\\nVraja (Vrindavana), O destroyer of all afflictions, O Janarddana, rescue\\nme who am sinking in the Kaurava Ocean. O Krishna, O Krishna, O thou\\ngreat yogin, thou soul of the universe, Thou creator of all things, O\\nGovinda, save me who am distressed,--who am losing my senses in the midst\\nof the Kurus.\\' Thus did that afflicted lady resplendent still in her\\nbeauty, O king covering her face cried aloud, thinking of Krishna, of\\nHari, of the lord of the three worlds. Hearing the words of Draupadi,\\nKrishna was deeply moved. And leaving his seat, the benevolent one from\\ncompassion, arrived there on foot. And while Yajnaseni was crying aloud\\nto Krishna, also called Vishnu and Hari and Nara for protection, the\\nillustrious Dharma, remaining unseen, covered her with excellent clothes\\nof many hues. And, O monarch as the attire of Draupadi was being dragged,\\nafter one was taken off, another of the same kind, appeared covering her.\\nAnd thus did it continue till many clothes were seen. And, O exalted on,\\nowing to the protection of Dharma, hundreds upon hundreds of robes of\\nmany hues came off Draupadi\\'s person. And there arose then a deep uproar\\nof many many voices. And the kings present in that assembly beholding\\nthat most extraordinary of all sights in the world, began to applaud\\nDraupadi and censure the son of Dhritarashtra. And Bhima then, squeezing\\nhis hands, with lips quivering in rage, swore in the midst of all those\\nkings a terrible oath in a loud voice.', '\"And Bhima said,--Hear these words of mine, ye Kshatriyas of the world.\\nWords such as these were never before uttered by other men, nor will\\nanybody in the future ever utter them. Ye lords of earth, if having\\nspoken these words I do not accomplish them hereafter, let me not obtain\\nthe region of my deceased ancestors. Tearing open in battle, by sheer\\nforce, the breast of this wretch, this wicked-minded scoundrel of the\\nBharata race, if I do not drink his life-blood, let me not obtain the\\nregion of my ancestors.\"', 'Vaisampayana continued,--\"Hearing these terrible words of Bhima that made\\nthe down of the auditors to stand on end, everybody present there\\napplauded him and censured the son of Dhritarashtra. And when a mass of\\nclothes had been gathered in that assembly, all dragged from the person\\nof Draupadi, Dussasana, tired and ashamed, sat down. And beholding the\\nsons of Kunti in that state, the persons--those gods among men--that were\\nin that assembly all uttered the word \\'Fie!\\'(on the son of\\nDhritarashtra). And the united voices of all became so loud that they\\nmade the down of anybody who heard them stand on end. And all the honest\\nmen that were in that assembly began to say,--\\'Alas! the Kauravas answer\\nnot the question that hath been put to them by Draupadi. And all\\ncensuring Dhritarashtra together, made a loud clamour. Then Vidura, that\\nmaster of the science of morality, waving his hands and silencing every\\none, spake these words;--\\'Ye that are in this assembly, Draupadi having\\nput her question is weeping helplessly. Ye are not answering her. Virtue\\nand morality are being persecuted by such conduct. An afflicted person\\napproacheth an assembly of good men, like one that is being consumed by\\nfire. They that are in the assembly quench that fire and cool him by\\nmeans of truth and morality. The afflicted person asketh the assembly\\nabout his rights, as sanctioned by morality. They that are in the\\nassembly should, unmoved by interest and anger, answer the question. Ye\\nkings, Vikarna hath answered the question, according to his own knowledge\\nand judgment. Ye should also answer it as ye think proper. Knowing the\\nrules of morality, and having attended an assembly, he that doth not\\nanswer a query that is put, incurreth half the demerit that attacheth to\\na lie. He, on the other hand, who, knowing the rules of morality and\\nhaving joined an assembly answereth falsely, assuredly incurreth the sin\\nof a lie. The learned quote as an example in this connection the old\\nhistory of Prahlada and the son of Angirasa.', '\"There was of old a chief of the Daityas of the name Prahlada. He had a\\nson named Virochana. And Virochana, for the sake of obtaining a bride,\\nquarrelled with Sudhanwan, the son of Angiras. It hath been heard by us\\nthat they mutually wagered their lives, saying--I am superior,--I am\\nsuperior,--for the sake of obtaining a bride. And after they had thus\\nquarrelled with each other, they both made Prahlada the arbitrator to\\ndecide between them. And they asked him, saying;--Who amongst us is\\nsuperior (to the other)? Answer this question. Speak not falsely.\\nFrightened at this quarrel, Prahlada cast his eyes upon Sudhanwan. And\\nSudhanwan in rage, burning like unto the mace of Yama, told him,--If thou\\nanswerest falsely, or dost not answer at all thy head will then be split\\ninto a hundred pieces by the wielder of the thunderbolt with that bolt of\\nhis.--Thus addressed by Sudhanwan, the Daitya, trembling like a leaf of\\nthe fig tree, went to Kasyapa of great energy, for taking counsel with\\nhim. And Prahlada said,--\\'Thou art, O illustrious and exalted one, fully\\nconversant with the rules of morality that should guide both the gods and\\nthe Asuras and the Brahmanas as well. Here, however, is a situation of\\ngreat difficulty in respect of duty. Tell me, I ask thee, what regions\\nare obtainable by them who upon being asked a question, answer it not, or\\nanswer it falsely. Kasyapa thus asked answered.--\\'He that knoweth, but\\nanswereth not a question from temptation, anger or fear, casteth upon\\nhimself a thousand nooses of Varuna. And the person who, cited as a\\nwitness with respect to any matter of ocular or auricular knowledge,\\nspeaketh carelessly, casteth a thousand nooses of Varuna upon his own\\nperson. On the completion of one full year, one such noose is loosened.\\nTherefore, he that knoweth, should speak the truth without concealment.\\nIf virtue, pierced by sin, repaireth to an assembly (for aid), it is the\\nduty of every body in the assembly to take off the dart, otherwise they\\nthemselves would be pierced with it. In an assembly where a truly\\ncensurable act is not rebuked, half the demerit of that act attacheth to\\nthe head of that assembly, a fourth to the person acting censurably and a\\nfourth unto those others that are there. In that assembly, on the other\\nhand, when he that deserveth censure is rebuked, the head of the assembly\\nbecometh freed from all sins, and the other members also incur none. It\\nis only the perpetrator himself of the act that becometh responsible for\\nit. O Prahlada, they who answer falsely those that ask them about\\nmorality destroy the meritorious acts of their seven upper and seven\\nlower generations. The grief of one who hath lost all his wealth, of one\\nwho hath lost a son, of one who is in debt, of one who is separated from\\nhis companions, of a woman who hath lost her husband, of one that hath\\nlost his all in consequence of the king\\'s demand, of a woman who is\\nsterile, of one who hath been devoured by a tiger (during his last\\nstruggles in the tiger\\'s claws), of one who is a co-wife, and of one who\\nhath been deprived of his property by false witnesses, have been said by\\nthe gods to be uniform in degree. These different sorts of grief are his\\nwho speaketh false. A person becometh a witness in consequence of his\\nhaving seen, heard, and understood a thing. Therefore, a witness should\\nalways tell the truth. A truth-telling witness never loseth his religious\\nmerits and earthly possessions also.\\' Hearing these words of Kasyapa,\\nPrahlada told his son, \"Sudhanwan is superior to thee, as indeed, (his\\nfather) Angiras is superior to me. The mother also of Sudhanwan is\\nsuperior to thy mother. Therefore, O Virochana, this Sudhanwan is now the\\nlord of the life.\" At these words of Prahlada, Sudhanwan said, \"Since\\nunmoved by affection for thy child, thou hast adhered to virtue, I\\ncommand, let this son of thine live for a hundred years.\"', '\"Vidura continued,--Let all the persons, therefore, present in this\\nassembly hearing these high truths of morality, reflect upon what should\\nbe the answer to the question asked by Draupadi\".', 'Vaisampayana continued,--\"The kings that were there hearing these words\\nof Vidura, answered not a word, yet Karna alone spoke unto Dussasana,\\ntelling him. Take away this serving-woman Krishna into the inner\\napartments. And thereupon Dussasana began to drag before all the\\nspectators the helpless and modest Draupadi, trembling and crying\\npiteously unto the Pandavas her lords.\"', '', 'Draupadi said,--\\'Wait a little, thou worst of men, thou wicked-minded\\nDussasana. I have an act to perform--a high duty that hath not been\\nperformed by me yet. Dragged forcibly by this wretch\\'s strong arms, I was\\ndeprived of my senses. I salute these reverend seniors in this assembly\\nof the Kurus. That I could not do this before cannot be my fault.\\'\"', 'Vaisampayana said,--\"Dragged with greater force than before, the\\nafflicted and helpless Draupadi, undeserving of such treatment, falling\\ndown upon the ground, thus wept in that assembly of the Kurus,--', '\"\\'Alas, only once before, on the occasion of the Swayamvara, I was beheld\\nby the assembled kings in the amphitheatre, and never even once beheld\\nafterwards. I am to-day brought before this assembly. She whom even the\\nwinds and the sun had seen never before in her palace is to-day before\\nthis assembly and exposed to the gaze of the crowd. Alas, she whom the\\nsons of Pandu could not, while in her palace, suffer to be touched even\\nby the wind, is to-day suffered by the Pandavas to be seized and dragged\\nby this wretch. Alas, these Kauravas also suffer their daughter-in-law,\\nso unworthy of such treatment, to be thus afflicted before them. It\\nseemeth that the times are out of joint. What can be more distressing to\\nme, than that though high-born and chaste, I should yet be compelled to\\nenter this public court? Where is that virtue for which these kings were\\nnoted? It hath been heard that the kings of ancient days never brought\\ntheir wedded wives into the public court. Alas, that eternal usage hath\\ndisappeared from among the Kauravas. Else, how is it that the chaste wife\\nof the Pandavas, the sister of Prishata\\'s son, the friend of Vasudeva, is\\nbrought before this assembly? Ye Kauravas, I am the wedded wife of king\\nYudhishthira the just, hailing from the same dynasty to which the King\\nbelonged. Tell me now if I am a serving-maid or otherwise. I will\\ncheerfully accept your answer. This mean wretch, this destroyer of the\\nname of the Kurus, is afflicting me hard. Ye Kauravas, I cannot bear it\\nany longer. Ye kings, I desire ye to answer whether ye regard me as won\\nor unwon. I will accept your verdict whatever it be.\\'', '\"Hearing these words, Bhishma answered, I have already said, O blessed\\none that the course of morality is subtle. Even the illustrious wise in\\nthis world fail to understand it always. What in this world a strong man\\ncalls morality is regarded as such by others, however otherwise it may\\nreally be; but what a weak man calls morality is scarcely regarded as\\nsuch even if it be the highest morality. From the importance of the issue\\ninvolved, from its intricacy and subtlety, I am unable to answer with\\ncertitude the question thou hast asked. However, it is certain that as\\nall the Kurus have become the slaves of covetousness and folly, the\\ndestruction of this our race will happen on no distant date. O blessed\\none, the family into which thou hast been admitted as a daughter-in-law,\\nis such that those who are born in it, however much they might be\\nafflicted by calamities, never deviate from the paths of virtue and\\nmorality. O Princess of Panchala, this conduct of thine also, viz. that\\nthough sunk in distress, thou still easiest thy eyes on virtue and\\nmorality, is assuredly worthy of thee. These persons, Drona and others,\\nof mature years and conversant with morality, sit heads downwards like\\nmen that are dead, with bodies from which life hath departed. It seemeth\\nto me, however, that Yudhishthira is an authority on this question. It\\nbehoveth him to declare whether thou art won or not won.\"', '', 'Vaisampayana said,--\"The kings present in that assembly, from tear of\\nDuryodhana, uttered not a word, good or ill, although they beheld\\nDraupadi crying piteously in affliction like a female osprey, and\\nrepeatedly appealing to them. And the son of Dhritarashtra beholding\\nthose kings and sons and grand sons of kings all remaining silent, smiled\\na little, and addressing the daughter of the king of Panchala, said,--O\\nYajnaseni, the question thou hast put dependeth on thy husbands--on Bhima\\nof mighty strength, on Arjuna, on Nakula, on Sahadeva. Let them answer\\nthy question. O Panchali, let them for thy sake declare in the midst of\\nthese respectable men that Yudhishthira is not their lord, let them\\nthereby make king Yudhishthira the just a liar. Thou shalt then be freed\\nfrom the condition of slavery. Let the illustrious son of Dharma, always\\nadhering to virtue, who is even like Indra, himself declare whether he is\\nnot thy lord. At his words, accept thou the Pandavas or ourselves without\\ndelay. Indeed, all the Kauravas present in this assembly are floating in\\nthe ocean of thy distress. Endued with magnanimity, they are unable to\\nanswer thy question, looking at thy unfortunate husbands.\\'\"', 'Vaisampayana continued,--\"Hearing these words of the Kuru king, all who\\nwere present in the assembly loudly applauded them. And shouting\\napprovingly, they made signs unto one another by motions of their eyes\\nand lips. And amongst some that were there, sounds of distress such as\\n\\'O! and \\'Alas!\" were heard. And at these words of Duryodhana, so\\ndelightful (to his partisans), the Kauravas present in that assembly\\nbecame exceedingly glad. And the kings, with faces turned sideways,\\nlooked upon Yudhishthira conversant with the rules of morality, curious\\nto hear what he would say. And every one present in that assembly became\\ncurious to hear what Arjuna, the son of Pandu never defeated in battle,\\nand what Bhimasena, and what the twins also would say. And when that busy\\nhum of many voices became still, Bhimasena, waving his strong and\\nwell-formed arms smeared with sandalpaste spake these words,--\\'If this\\nhigh-souled king Yudhishthira the just, who is our eldest brother, had\\nnot been our lord, we would never have forgiven the Kuru race (for all\\nthis). He is the lord of all our religious and ascetic merits, the lord\\nof even our lives. If he regardeth himself as won, we too have all been\\nwon. If this were not so, who is there amongst creatures touching the\\nearth with their feet and mortal, that would escape from me with his life\\nafter having touched those locks of the princess of Panchala? Behold\\nthese mighty, well-formed arms of mine, even like maces of iron. Having\\nonce come within them, even he of a hundred sacrifices is incapable of\\neffecting an escape. Bound by the ties of virtue and the reverence that\\nis due to our eldest brother, and repeatedly urged by Arjuna to remain\\nsilent, I am not doing anything terrible. If however, I am once commanded\\nby king Yudhishthira the just, I would slay these wretched sons of\\nDhritarashtra, making slaps do the work of swords, like a lion slaying a\\nnumber of little animals.\"', 'Vaisampayana continued,--\"Unto Bhima who had spoken these words Bhishma\\nand Drona and Vidura said, \\'Forbear, O Bhima. Everything is possible with\\nthee.\\'\"', '', '\"Karna said,--\\'Of all the persons in the assembly, three, viz., Bhishma,\\nVidura, and the preceptor of the Kurus (Drona) appear to be independent;\\nfor they always speak of their master as wicked, always censure him, and\\nnever wish for his prosperity. O excellent one, the slave, the son, and\\nthe wife are always dependent. They cannot earn wealth, for whatever they\\nearn belongeth to their master. Thou art the wife of a slave incapable of\\npossessing anything on his own account. Repair now to the inner\\napartments of king Dhritarashtra and serve the king\\'s relatives. We\\ndirect that that is now thy proper business. And, O princess, all the\\nsons of Dhritarashtra and not the sons of Pritha are now thy masters. O\\nhandsome one, select thou another husband now,--one who will not make\\nthee a slave by gambling. It is well-known that women, especially that\\nare slaves, are not censurable if they proceed with freedom in electing\\nhusbands. Therefore let it be done by thee. Nakula hath been won, as also\\nBhimasena, and Yudhishthira also, and Sahadeva, and Arjuna. And, O\\nYajnaseni, thou art now a slave. Thy husbands that are slaves cannot\\ncontinue to be thy lords any longer. Alas, doth not the son of Pritha\\nregards life, prowess and manhood as of no use that he offereth this\\ndaughter of Drupada, the king of Panchala, in the presence of all this\\nassembly, as a stake at dice?\\'\"', 'Vaisampayana continued,--\"Hearing these words, the wrathful Bhima\\nbreathed hard, a very picture of woe. Obedient to the king and bound by\\nthe tie of virtue and duty, burning everything with his eyes inflamed by\\nanger, he said,--\\'O king, I cannot be angry at these words of this son of\\na Suta, for we have truly entered the state of servitude. But O king,\\ncould our enemies have said so unto me, it thou hadst not played staking\\nthis princess?\\'\"', 'Vaisampayana continued,--\"Hearing these words of Bhimasena king\\nDuryodhana addressed Yudhishthira who was silent and deprived of his\\nsenses, saying,--\\'O king, both Bhima and Arjuna, and the twins also, are\\nunder thy sway. Answer thou the question (that hath been asked by\\nDraupadi). Say, whether thou regardest Krishna as unwon.\\' And having\\nspoken thus unto the son of Kunti, Duryodhana. desirous of encouraging\\nthe son of Radha and insulting Bhima, quickly uncovered his left thigh\\nthat was like unto the stem of a plantain tree or the trunk of an\\nelephant and which was graced with every auspicious sign and endued with\\nthe strength of thunder, and showed it to Draupadi in her very sight. And\\nbeholding this, Bhimasena expanding his red eyes, said unto Duryodhana in\\nthe midst of all those kings and as if piercing them (with his dart-like\\nwords),--\\'Let not Vrikodara attain to the regions, obtained by his\\nancestors, if he doth not break that thigh of thine in the great\\nconflict. And sparkles of fire began to be emitted from every organ of\\nsense of Bhima filled with wrath, like those that come out of every crack\\nand orifice in the body of a blazing tree.', \"Vidura then, addressing everybody, said,--'Ye kings of Pratipa's race,\\nbehold the great danger that ariseth from Bhimasena. Know ye for certain\\nthat this great calamity that threatens to overtake the Bharatas hath\\nbeen sent by Destiny itself. The sons of Dhritarashtra have, indeed,\\ngambled disregarding every proper consideration. They are even now\\ndisputing in this assembly about a lady (of the royal household). The\\nprosperity of our kingdom is at an end. Alas, the Kauravas are even now\\nengaged in sinful consultations. Ye Kauravas, take to your heart this\\nhigh precept that I declare. If virtue is persecuted, the whole assembly\\nbecometh polluted. If Yudhishthira had staked her before he was himself\\nwon, he would certainly have been regarded as her master. If, however a\\nperson staketh anything at a time when he himself is incapable of holding\\nany wealth, to win it is very like obtaining wealth in a dream. Listening\\nto the words of the king of Gandhara, fall ye not off from this undoubted\\ntruth.'\", '\"Duryodhana, hearing Vidura thus speak, said,--\\'I am willing to abide by\\nthe words of Bhima, of Arjuna and of the twins. Let them say that\\nYudhishthira is not their master. Yajnaseni will then be freed from her\\nstate of bondage.\"', '\"Arjuna at this, said,--\"This illustrious son of Kunti, king Yudhishthira\\nthe just, was certainly our master before he began to play. But having\\nlost himself, let all the Kauravas judge whose master he could be after\\nthat.\"', 'Vaisampayana continued,--\"Just then, a jackal began to cry loudly in the\\nhoma-chamber of king Dhritarashtra\\'s palace. And, O king, unto the jackal\\nthat howled so, the asses began to bray responsively. And terrible birds\\nalso, from all sides, began to answer with their cries. And Vidura\\nconversant with everything and the daughter of Suvala, both understood\\nthe meaning of those terrible sounds. And Bhishma and Drona and the\\nlearned Gautama loudly cried,--Swashti! Swashti![1] Then Gandhari and the\\nlearned Vidura beholding that frightful omen, represented everything, in\\ngreat affliction, unto the king. And the king (Dhritarashtra) thereupon\\nsaid,--', \"'Thou wicked-minded Duryodhana, thou wretch, destruction hath all ready\\novertaken thee when thou insultest in language such as this the wife of\\nthese bulls among the Kurus, especially their wedded wife Draupadi. And\\nhaving spoken those words, the wise Dhritarashtra endued with knowledge,\\nreflecting with the aid of his wisdom and desirous of saving his\\nrelatives and friends from destruction, began to console Krishna, the\\nprincess of Panchala, and addressing her, the monarch said,--'Ask of me\\nany boon, O princess of Panchala, that thou desirest, Chaste and devoted\\nto virtue, thou art the first of all my daughters-in-law.\", '\"Draupadi said,--\\'O bull of the Bharata race, if thou will grant me a\\nboon, I ask the handsome Yudhishthira, obedient to every duty, be freed\\nfrom slavery.

O\\nYudhishthira, O child, thou knowest the subtle path of morality.\\nPossessed of great wisdom, thou art also humble, and thou waitest also\\nupon the old. Where there is intelligence, there is forbearance.\\nTherefore, O Bharata, follow thou counsels of peace. The axe falleth upon\\nwood, not upon stone. (Thou art open to advice, not Duryodhana). They are\\nthe best of men that remember not the acts of hostility of their foes;\\nthat behold only the merits, not the faults, of their enemies; and that\\nnever enter into hostilities themselves. They that are good remember only\\nthe good deeds of their foes and not the hostile acts their foes might\\nhave done unto them. The good, besides, do good unto others without\\nexpectation of any good, in return. O Yudhishthira, it is only the worst\\nof men that utter harsh words in quarrelling; while they that are\\nindifferent reply to such when spoken by others. But they that are good\\nand wise never think of or recapitulate such harsh words, little caring\\nwhether these may or may not have been uttered by their foes. They that\\nare good, having regard to the state of their own feelings, can\\nunderstand the feelings of others, and therefore remember only the good\\ndeeds and not the acts of hostility of their foes. Thou hast acted even\\nas good men of prepossessing countenance do, who transgress not the\\nlimits of virtue, wealth, pleasure and salvation. O child, remember not\\nthe harsh words of Duryodhana. Look at thy mother Gandhari and myself\\nalso, if thou desirest to remember only what is good. O Bharata, look at\\nme, who am thy father unto you and am old and blind, and still alive. It\\nwas for seeing our friends and examining also the strength and weakness\\nof my children, that I had, from motives of policy, suffered this match\\nat dice to proceed. O king those amongst the Kurus that have thee for\\ntheir ruler, and the intelligent Vidura conversant with every branch of\\nlearning for their counsellor, have, indeed, nothing to grieve for. In\\nthee is virtue, in Arjuna is patience, in Bhimasena is prowess, and the\\ntwins, those foremost of men, is pure reverence for superiors. Blest be\\nthou, O Ajatasatru. Return to Khandavaprastha, and let there be brotherly\\nlove between thee and thy cousins. Let thy heart also be ever fixed on\\nvirtue.\\'\"', 'Vaisampayana continued,--\"That foremost of the Bharatas--king\\nYudhishthira the just--then, thus addressed by his uncle, having gone\\nthrough every ceremony of politeness, set out with his brothers for\\nKhandavaprastha. And accompanied by Draupadi and ascending their cars\\nwhich were all of the hue of the clouds, with cheerful hearts they all\\nset out for that best of cities called Indraprastha.\"', '']\n"

Let her sweep the chambers, force her\\nthereto, and let the unfortunate one stay where our serving-women are.'\", '\"Vidura said,--\\'Dost thou not know, O wretch, that by uttering such harsh\\nwords thou art tying thyself with cords? Dost thou not understand that\\nthou art hanging on the edge of a precipice? Dost thou not know that\\nbeing a deer thou provokest so many tigers to rage? Snakes of deadly\\nvenom, provoked to ire, are on thy head! Wretch, do not further provoke\\nthem lest thou goest to the region of Yama. In my judgement, slavery does\\nnot attach to Krishna, in as much as she was staked by the King after he\\nhad lost himself and ceased to be his own master. Like the bamboo that\\nbeareth fruit only when it is about to die, the son of Dhritarashtra\\nwinneth this treasure at play. Intoxicated, he perceiveth nor in these\\nhis last moments that dice bring about enmity and frightful terrors. No\\nman should utter harsh speeches and pierce the hearts of the others. No\\nman should subjugate his enemies by dice and such other foul means. No\\none should utter such words as are disapproved by the Vedas and lead to\\nhell and annoy others. Some one uttereth from his lips words that are\\nharsh. Stung by them another burneth day and night. These words pierce\\nthe very heart of another. The learned, therefore, should never utter\\nthem, pointing them at others. A goat had once swallowed a hook, and when\\nit was pierced with it, the hunter placing the head of the animal on the\\nground tore its throat frightfully in drawing it out. Therefore, O\\nDuryodhana, swallow not the wealth of the Pandavas. Make them not thy\\nenemies. The sons of Pritha never use words such as these. It is only low\\nmen that are like dogs who use harsh words towards all classes of people,\\nviz., those that have retired to the woods, those leading domestic lives,\\nthose employed in ascetic devotions and those that are of great learning.\\nAlas! the son of Dhritarashtra knoweth not that dishonesty is one of the\\nfrightful doors of hell. Alas! many of the Kurus with Dussasana amongst\\nthem have followed him in the path of dishonesty in the matter of this\\nplay at dice. Even gourds may sink and stones may float, and boats also\\nmay always sink in water, still this foolish king, the son of\\nDhritarashtra, listeneth not to my words that are even as regimen unto\\nhim. Without doubt, he will be the cause of the destruction of the Kurus.\\nWhen the words of wisdom spoken by friends and which are even as fit\\nregimen are not listened to, but on the other hand temptation is on the\\nincrease, a frightful and universal destruction is sure to overtake all\\nthe Kurus.\"', '', 'Vaisampayana said,--\"Intoxicated with pride, the son of Dhritarashtra\\nspake,--\\'Fie on Kshatta! and casting his eyes upon the Pratikamin in\\nattendance, commanded him, in the midst of all those reverend seniors,\\nsaying,--\\'Go Pratikamin, and bring thou Draupadi hither.

It is Vidura alone that raveth in fear.\\nBesides, he never wisheth our prosperity!\\'\"', 'Vaisampayana continued,--\"Thus commanded, the Pratikamin, who was of the\\nSuta caste, hearing the words of the king, proceeded with haste, and\\nentering the abode of the Pandavas, like a dog in a lion\\'s den,\\napproached the queen of the sons of Pandu. And he said,--\\'Yudhishthira\\nhaving been intoxicated with dice, Duryodhana, O Draupadi, hath won thee.\\nCome now, therefore, to the abode of Dhritarashtra. I will take thee, O\\nYajnaseni, and put thee in some menial work.\\'', \"Draupadi said,--'Why, O Pratikamin, dost thou say so? What prince is\\nthere who playeth staking his wife? The king was certainly intoxicated\\nwith dice. Else, could he not find any other object to stake?'\", '\"The Pratikamin said,--\\'When he had nothing else to stake, it was then\\nthat Ajatasatru, the son of Pandu, staked thee. The king had first staked\\nhis brothers, then himself, and then thee, O princess.\\'', '\"Draupadi said,--\\'O son of the Suta race, go, and ask that gambler\\npresent in the assembly, whom he hath lost first, himself, or me.\\nAscertaining this, come hither, and then take me with thee, O son of the\\nSuta race.\\'', 'Vaisampayana continued,--\"The messenger coming back to the assembly told\\nall present the words of Draupadi. And he spoke unto Yudhishthira sitting\\nin the midst of the kings, these words,--Draupadi hath asked thee, Whose\\nlord wert thou at the time thou lost me in play? Didst thou lose thyself\\nfirst or me? Yudhishthira, however sat there like one demented and\\ndeprived of reason and gave no answer good or ill to the Suta.', '\"Duryodhana then said,--\\'Let the princess of Panchala come hither and put\\nher question. Let every one hear in this assembly the words that pass\\nbetween her and Yudhishthira.\\'', 'Vaisampayana continued,--\"The messenger, obedient to the command of\\nDuryodhana, going once again to the palace, himself much distressed, said\\nunto Draupadi,--\\'O princess, they that are in the assembly are summoning\\nthee. It seemeth that the end of the Kauravas is at hand. When\\nDuryodhana, O princess, is for taking thee before the assembly, this\\nweak-brained king will no longer be able to protect his prosperity.\\'', '\"Draupadi said,--\\'The great ordainer of the world hath, indeed, ordained\\nso. Happiness and misery pay their court to both the wise and unwise.\\nMorality, however, it hath been said, is the one highest object in the\\nworld. If cherished, that will certainly dispense blessings to us. Let\\nnot that morality now abandon the Kauravas. Going back to those that are\\npresent in that assembly, repeat these my words consonant with morality.\\nI am ready to do what those elderly and virtuous persons conversant with\\nmorality will definitely tell me.', 'Vaisampayana continued,--\"The Suta, hearing these words of Yajnaseni,\\ncame back to the assembly and repeated the words of Draupadi. But all sat\\nwith faces downwards, uttering not a word, knowing the eagerness and\\nresolution of Dhritarashtra\\'s son.', '\"Yudhishthira, however, O bull of the Bharata race, hearing of\\nDuryodhana\\'s intentions, sent a trusted messenger unto Draupadi,\\ndirecting that although she was attired in one piece of cloth with her\\nnavel itself exposed, in consequence of her season having come, she\\nshould come before her father-in-law weeping bitterly. And that\\nintelligent messenger, O king, having gone to Draupadi\\'s abode with\\nspeed, informed her of the intentions of Yudhishthira. The illustrious\\nPandavas, meanwhile, distressed and sorrowful, and bound by promise,\\ncould not settle what they should do. And casting his eyes upon them,\\nking Duryodhana, glad at heart, addressed the Suta and said,--\\'O\\nPratikamin, bring her hither. Let the Kauravas answer her question before\\nher face. The Suta, then, obedient to his commands, but terrified at the\\n(possible) wrath of the daughter of Drupada, disregarding his reputation\\nfor intelligence, once again said to those that were in the\\nassembly,--what shall I say unto Krishna?\\'', '\"Duryodhana, hearing this, said,--\\'O Dussasana, this son of my Suta, of\\nlittle intelligence, feareth Vrikodara. Therefore, go thou thyself and\\nforcibly bring hither the daughter of Yajnasena, Our enemies at present\\nare dependent on our will. What can they do thee?\\' Hearing the command of\\nhis brother, prince Dussasana rose with blood-red eyes, and entering the\\nabode of those great warriors, spake these words unto the princess,\\n\\'Come, come, O Krishna, princess of Panchala, thou hast been won by us.\\nAnd O thou of eyes large as lotus leaves, come now and accept the Kurus\\nfor thy lords. Thou hast been won virtuously, come to the assembly.\\' At\\nthese words, Draupadi, rising up in great affliction, rubbed her pale\\nface with her hands, and distressed she ran to the place where the ladies\\nof Dhritarashtra\\'s household were. At this, Dussasana roaring in anger,\\nran after her and seized the queen by her locks, so long and blue and\\nwavy. Alas! those locks that had been sprinkled with water sanctified\\nwith mantras in the great Rajasuya sacrifice, were now forcibly seized by\\nthe son of Dhritarashtra disregarding the prowess of the Pandavas. And\\nDussasana dragging Krishna of long long locks unto the presence of the\\nassembly--as if she were helpless though having powerful protectors--and\\npulling at her, made her tremble like the banana plant in a storm. And\\ndragged by him, with body bent, she faintly cried--\\'Wretch! it ill\\nbehoveth thee to take me before the assembly. My season hath come, and I\\nam now clad in one piece of attire. But Dussasana dragging Draupadi\\nforcibly by her black locks while she was praying piteously unto Krishna\\nand Vishnu who were Narayana and Nara (on earth), said unto her--\\'Whether\\nthy season hath come or not, whether thou art attired in one piece of\\ncloth or entirely naked, when thou hast been won at dice and made our\\nslave, thou art to live amongst our serving-women as thou pleasest.\"', 'Vaisampayana continued,--\"With hair dishevelled and half her attire\\nloosened, all the while dragged by Dussasana, the modest Krishna consumed\\nwith anger, faintly said--\"In this assembly are persons conversant with\\nall the branches of learning devoted to the performance of sacrifices and\\nother rites, and all equal unto Indra, persons some of whom are really my\\nsuperiors and others who deserve to be respected as such. I can not stay\\nbefore them in this state. O wretch! O thou of cruel deeds, drag me not\\nso. Uncover me not so. The princes (my lords) will not pardon thee, even\\nif thou hast the gods themselves with Indra as thy allies. The\\nillustrious son of Dharma is now bound by the obligations of morality.\\nMorality, however, is subtle. Those only that are possessed of great\\nclearness of vision can ascertain it. In speech even I am unwilling to\\nadmit an atom of fault in my lord forgetting his virtues. Thou draggest\\nme who am in my season before these Kuru heroes. This is truly an\\nunworthy act. But no one here rebuketh thee. Assuredly, all these are of\\nthe same mind with thee. O fie! Truly hath the virtue of the Bharata\\ngone! Truly also hath the usage of those acquainted with the Kshatriya\\npractice disappeared! Else these Kurus in this assembly would never have\\nlooked silently on this act that transgresseth the limits of their\\npractices. Oh! both Drona and Bhishma have lost their energy, and so also\\nhath the high-souled Kshatta, and so also this king. Else, why do these\\nforemost of the Kuru elders look silently on this great crime?\"', 'Vaisampayana continued,--\"Thus did Krishna of slender waist cry in\\ndistress in that assembly. And casting a glance upon her enraged\\nlords--the Pandavas--who were filled with terrible wrath, she inflamed\\nthem further with that glance of hers. And they were not so distressed at\\nhaving been robbed of their kingdom, of their wealth, of their costliest\\ngems, as with that glance of Krishna moved by modesty and anger. And\\nDussasana, beholding Krishna looking at her helpless lords, dragging her\\nstill more forcibly, and addressed her, \\'Slave, Slave\\' and laughed aloud.\\nAnd at those words Karna became very glad and approved of them by\\nlaughing aloud. And Sakuni, the son of Suvala, the Gandhara king,\\nsimilarly applauded Dussasana. And amongst all those that were in the\\nassembly except these three and Duryodhana, every one was filled with\\nsorrow at beholding Krishna thus dragged in sight of that assembly. And\\nbeholding it all, Bhishma said, \\'O blessed one, morality is subtle. I\\ntherefore am unable to duly decide this point that thou hast put,\\nbeholding that on the one hand one that hath no wealth cannot stake the\\nwealth belonging to others, while on the other hand wives are always\\nunder the orders and at the disposal of their lords. Yudhishthira can\\nabandon the whole world full of wealth, but he will never sacrifice\\nmorality. The son of Pandu hath said--\\'I am won.\\' Therefore, I am unable\\nto decide this matter. Sakuni hath not his equal among men at dice-play.\\nThe son of Kunti still voluntarily staked with him. The illustrious\\nYudhishthira doth not himself regard that Sakuni hath played with him\\ndeceitfully. Therefore, I can not decide this point.\"', '\"Draupadi said,--\"The king was summoned to this assembly and though\\npossessing no skill at dice, he was made to play with skilful, wicked,\\ndeceitful and desperate gamblers. How can he be said then to have staked\\nvoluntarily? The chief of the Pandavas was deprived of his senses by\\nwretches of deceitful conduct and unholy instincts, acting together, and\\nthen vanquished. He could not understand their tricks, but he hath now\\ndone so. Here, in this assembly, there are Kurus who are the lords of\\nboth their sons and their daughters-in-law! Let all of them, reflecting\\nwell upon my words, duly decide the point that I have put.', 'Vaisampayana continued,--\\'Unto Krishna who was thus weeping and crying\\npiteously, looking at times upon her helpless lord, Dussasana spake many\\ndisagreeable and harsh words. And beholding her who was then in her\\nseason thus dragged, and her upper garments loosened, beholding her in\\nthat condition which she little deserved, Vrikodara afflicted beyond\\nendurance, his eyes fixed upon Yudhishthira, gave way to wrath.\"', '\"Bhima said,--\\'O Yudhishthira, gamblers have in their houses many women\\nof loose character. They do not yet stake those women having kindness for\\nthem even. Whatever wealth and other excellent articles the king of Kasi\\ngave, whatever, gems, animals, wealth, coats of mail and weapons that\\nother kings of the earth gave, our kingdom, thyself and ourselves, have\\nall been won by the foes. At all this my wrath was not excited for thou\\nart our lord. This, however, I regard as a highly improper act--this act\\nof staking Draupadi. This innocent girl deserveth not this treatment.\\nHaving obtained the Pandavas as her lords, it is for thee alone that she\\nis being thus persecuted by the low, despicable, cruel, and mean-minded\\nKauravas. It is for her sake, O king, that my anger falleth on thee. I\\nshall burn those hands of thine. Sahadeva, bring some fire.\"', \"'Arjuna hearing this, said,--'Thou hast never, O Bhimasena, before this\\nuttered such words as these. Assuredly thy high morality hath been\\ndestroyed by these cruel foes. Thou shouldst not fulfil the wishes of the\\nenemy. Practise thou the highest morality. Whom doth it behave to\\ntransgress his virtuous eldest brother? The king was summoned by the foe,\\nand remembering the usage of the Kshatriyas, he played at dice against\\nhis will. That is certainly conducive to our great fame.\", '\\'Bhima said,--\\'If I had not known, O Dhananjaya, that the king had acted\\naccording to Kshatriya usage, then I would have, taking his hands\\ntogether by sheer force, burnt them in a blazing fire.\"', 'Vaisampayana continued,--\"Beholding the Pandavas thus distressed and the\\nprincess of Panchala also thus afflicted, Vikarna the son of\\nDhritarashtra said--\\'Ye kings, answer ye the question that hath been\\nasked by Yajnaseni. If we do not judge a matter referred to us, all of us\\nwill assuredly have to go to hell without delay. How is that Bhishma and\\nDhritarashtra, both of whom are the oldest of the Kurus, as also the\\nhigh-souled Vidura, do not say anything! The son of Bharadwaja who is the\\npreceptor of us, as also Kripa, is here. Why do not these best of\\nregenerate ones answer the question? Let also those other kings assembled\\nhere from all directions answer according to their judgment this\\nquestion, leaving aside all motives of gain and anger. Ye kings, answer\\nye the question that hath been asked by this blessed daughter of king\\nDrupada, and declare after reflection on which side each of ye is.\\' Thus\\ndid Vikarna repeatedly appeal to those that were in that assembly. But\\nthose kings answered him not one word, good or ill. And Vikarna having\\nrepeatedly appealed to all the kings began to rub his hands and sigh like\\na snake. And at last the prince said--\\'Ye kings of the earth, ye\\nKauravas, whether ye answer this question or not, I will say what I\\nregard as just and proper. Ye foremost of men, it hath been said that\\nhunting, drinking, gambling, and too much enjoyment of women, are the\\nfour vices of kings. The man, that is addicted to these, liveth forsaking\\nvirtue. And people do not regard the acts done by a person who is thus\\nimproperly engaged, as of any authority. This son of Pandu, while deeply\\nengaged in one of these vicious acts, urged thereto by deceitful\\ngamblers, made Draupadi a stake. The innocent Draupadi is, besides, the\\ncommon wife of all the sons of Pandu. And the king, having first lost\\nhimself offered her as a stake. And Suvala himself desirous of a stake,\\nindeed prevailed upon the king to stake this Krishna. Reflecting upon all\\nthese circumstances, I regard Draupadi as not won.\"', '\"Hearing these words, a loud uproar rose from among those present in that\\nassembly. And they all applauded Vikarna and censured the son of Suvala.\\nAnd at that sound, the son of Radha, deprived of his senses by anger,\\nwaving his well-shaped arms, said these words,--\\'O Vikarna, many opposite\\nand inconsistent conditions are noticeable in this assembly. Like fire\\nproduced from a faggot, consuming the faggot itself, this thy ire will\\nconsume thee. These personages here, though urged by Krishna, have not\\nuttered a word. They all regard the daughter of Drupada to have been\\nproperly won. Thou alone, O son of Dhritarashtra in consequence of thy\\nimmature years, art bursting with wrath, for though but a boy thou\\nspeakest in the assembly as if thou wert old. O younger brother of\\nDuryodhana, thou dost not know what morality truly is, for thou sayest\\nlike a fool that this Krishna who hath been (justly) won as not won at\\nall. O son of Dhritarashtra, how dost thou regard Krishna as not won,\\nwhen the eldest of the Pandavas before this assembly staked all his\\npossessions? O bull of the Bharata race, Draupadi is included in all the\\npossessions (of Yudhishthira). Therefore, why regardest thou Krishna who\\nhath been justly won as not won? Draupadi had been mentioned (by Suvala)\\nand approved of as a stake by the Pandavas. For what reason then dost\\nthou yet regard her as not won? Or, if thou thinkest that bringing her\\nhither attired in a single piece of cloth, is an action of impropriety,\\nlisten to certain excellent reasons I will give. O son of the Kuru race,\\nthe gods have ordained only one husband for one woman. This Draupadi,\\nhowever, hath many husbands. Therefore, certain it is that she is an\\nunchaste woman. To bring her, therefore, into this assembly attired\\nthough she be in one piece of cloth--even to uncover her is not at all an\\nact that may cause surprise. Whatever wealth the Pandavas had--she\\nherself and these Pandavas themselves,--have all been justly won by the\\nson of Suvala. O Dussasana, this Vikarna speaking words of (apparent)\\nwisdom is but a boy. Take off the robes of the Pandavas as also the\\nattire of Draupadi. Hearing these words the Pandavas, O Bharata, took of\\ntheir upper garments and throwing them down sat in that assembly. Then\\nDussasana, O king, forcibly seizing Draupadi\\'s attire before the eyes of\\nall, began to drag it off her person.\"', 'Vaisampayana continued,--\"When the attire of Draupadi was being thus\\ndragged, the thought of Hari, (And she herself cried aloud, saying), \\'O\\nGovinda, O thou who dwellest in Dwaraka, O Krishna, O thou who art fond\\nof cow-herdesses (of Vrindavana). O Kesava, seest thou not that the\\nKauravas are humiliating me. O Lord, O husband of Lakshmi, O Lord of\\nVraja (Vrindavana), O destroyer of all afflictions, O Janarddana, rescue\\nme who am sinking in the Kaurava Ocean. O Krishna, O Krishna, O thou\\ngreat yogin, thou soul of the universe, Thou creator of all things, O\\nGovinda, save me who am distressed,--who am losing my senses in the midst\\nof the Kurus.\\' Thus did that afflicted lady resplendent still in her\\nbeauty, O king covering her face cried aloud, thinking of Krishna, of\\nHari, of the lord of the three worlds. Hearing the words of Draupadi,\\nKrishna was deeply moved. And leaving his seat, the benevolent one from\\ncompassion, arrived there on foot. And while Yajnaseni was crying aloud\\nto Krishna, also called Vishnu and Hari and Nara for protection, the\\nillustrious Dharma, remaining unseen, covered her with excellent clothes\\nof many hues. And, O monarch as the attire of Draupadi was being dragged,\\nafter one was taken off, another of the same kind, appeared covering her.\\nAnd thus did it continue till many clothes were seen. And, O exalted on,\\nowing to the protection of Dharma, hundreds upon hundreds of robes of\\nmany hues came off Draupadi\\'s person. And there arose then a deep uproar\\nof many many voices. And the kings present in that assembly beholding\\nthat most extraordinary of all sights in the world, began to applaud\\nDraupadi and censure the son of Dhritarashtra. And Bhima then, squeezing\\nhis hands, with lips quivering in rage, swore in the midst of all those\\nkings a terrible oath in a loud voice.', '\"And Bhima said,--Hear these words of mine, ye Kshatriyas of the world.\\nWords such as these were never before uttered by other men, nor will\\nanybody in the future ever utter them. Ye lords of earth, if having\\nspoken these words I do not accomplish them hereafter, let me not obtain\\nthe region of my deceased ancestors. Tearing open in battle, by sheer\\nforce, the breast of this wretch, this wicked-minded scoundrel of the\\nBharata race, if I do not drink his life-blood, let me not obtain the\\nregion of my ancestors.\"', 'Vaisampayana continued,--\"Hearing these terrible words of Bhima that made\\nthe down of the auditors to stand on end, everybody present there\\napplauded him and censured the son of Dhritarashtra. And when a mass of\\nclothes had been gathered in that assembly, all dragged from the person\\nof Draupadi, Dussasana, tired and ashamed, sat down. And beholding the\\nsons of Kunti in that state, the persons--those gods among men--that were\\nin that assembly all uttered the word \\'Fie!\\'(on the son of\\nDhritarashtra). And the united voices of all became so loud that they\\nmade the down of anybody who heard them stand on end. And all the honest\\nmen that were in that assembly began to say,--\\'Alas! the Kauravas answer\\nnot the question that hath been put to them by Draupadi. And all\\ncensuring Dhritarashtra together, made a loud clamour. Then Vidura, that\\nmaster of the science of morality, waving his hands and silencing every\\none, spake these words;--\\'Ye that are in this assembly, Draupadi having\\nput her question is weeping helplessly. Ye are not answering her. Virtue\\nand morality are being persecuted by such conduct. An afflicted person\\napproacheth an assembly of good men, like one that is being consumed by\\nfire. They that are in the assembly quench that fire and cool him by\\nmeans of truth and morality. The afflicted person asketh the assembly\\nabout his rights, as sanctioned by morality. They that are in the\\nassembly should, unmoved by interest and anger, answer the question. Ye\\nkings, Vikarna hath answered the question, according to his own knowledge\\nand judgment. Ye should also answer it as ye think proper. Knowing the\\nrules of morality, and having attended an assembly, he that doth not\\nanswer a query that is put, incurreth half the demerit that attacheth to\\na lie. He, on the other hand, who, knowing the rules of morality and\\nhaving joined an assembly answereth falsely, assuredly incurreth the sin\\nof a lie. The learned quote as an example in this connection the old\\nhistory of Prahlada and the son of Angirasa.', '\"There was of old a chief of the Daityas of the name Prahlada. He had a\\nson named Virochana. And Virochana, for the sake of obtaining a bride,\\nquarrelled with Sudhanwan, the son of Angiras. It hath been heard by us\\nthat they mutually wagered their lives, saying--I am superior,--I am\\nsuperior,--for the sake of obtaining a bride. And after they had thus\\nquarrelled with each other, they both made Prahlada the arbitrator to\\ndecide between them. And they asked him, saying;--Who amongst us is\\nsuperior (to the other)? Answer this question. Speak not falsely.\\nFrightened at this quarrel, Prahlada cast his eyes upon Sudhanwan. And\\nSudhanwan in rage, burning like unto the mace of Yama, told him,--If thou\\nanswerest falsely, or dost not answer at all thy head will then be split\\ninto a hundred pieces by the wielder of the thunderbolt with that bolt of\\nhis.--Thus addressed by Sudhanwan, the Daitya, trembling like a leaf of\\nthe fig tree, went to Kasyapa of great energy, for taking counsel with\\nhim. And Prahlada said,--\\'Thou art, O illustrious and exalted one, fully\\nconversant with the rules of morality that should guide both the gods and\\nthe Asuras and the Brahmanas as well. Here, however, is a situation of\\ngreat difficulty in respect of duty. Tell me, I ask thee, what regions\\nare obtainable by them who upon being asked a question, answer it not, or\\nanswer it falsely. Kasyapa thus asked answered.--\\'He that knoweth, but\\nanswereth not a question from temptation, anger or fear, casteth upon\\nhimself a thousand nooses of Varuna. And the person who, cited as a\\nwitness with respect to any matter of ocular or auricular knowledge,\\nspeaketh carelessly, casteth a thousand nooses of Varuna upon his own\\nperson. On the completion of one full year, one such noose is loosened.\\nTherefore, he that knoweth, should speak the truth without concealment.\\nIf virtue, pierced by sin, repaireth to an assembly (for aid), it is the\\nduty of every body in the assembly to take off the dart, otherwise they\\nthemselves would be pierced with it. In an assembly where a truly\\ncensurable act is not rebuked, half the demerit of that act attacheth to\\nthe head of that assembly, a fourth to the person acting censurably and a\\nfourth unto those others that are there. In that assembly, on the other\\nhand, when he that deserveth censure is rebuked, the head of the assembly\\nbecometh freed from all sins, and the other members also incur none. It\\nis only the perpetrator himself of the act that becometh responsible for\\nit. O Prahlada, they who answer falsely those that ask them about\\nmorality destroy the meritorious acts of their seven upper and seven\\nlower generations. The grief of one who hath lost all his wealth, of one\\nwho hath lost a son, of one who is in debt, of one who is separated from\\nhis companions, of a woman who hath lost her husband, of one that hath\\nlost his all in consequence of the king\\'s demand, of a woman who is\\nsterile, of one who hath been devoured by a tiger (during his last\\nstruggles in the tiger\\'s claws), of one who is a co-wife, and of one who\\nhath been deprived of his property by false witnesses, have been said by\\nthe gods to be uniform in degree. These different sorts of grief are his\\nwho speaketh false. A person becometh a witness in consequence of his\\nhaving seen, heard, and understood a thing. Therefore, a witness should\\nalways tell the truth. A truth-telling witness never loseth his religious\\nmerits and earthly possessions also.\\' Hearing these words of Kasyapa,\\nPrahlada told his son, \"Sudhanwan is superior to thee, as indeed, (his\\nfather) Angiras is superior to me. The mother also of Sudhanwan is\\nsuperior to thy mother. Therefore, O Virochana, this Sudhanwan is now the\\nlord of the life.\" At these words of Prahlada, Sudhanwan said, \"Since\\nunmoved by affection for thy child, thou hast adhered to virtue, I\\ncommand, let this son of thine live for a hundred years.\"', '\"Vidura continued,--Let all the persons, therefore, present in this\\nassembly hearing these high truths of morality, reflect upon what should\\nbe the answer to the question asked by Draupadi\".', 'Vaisampayana continued,--\"The kings that were there hearing these words\\nof Vidura, answered not a word, yet Karna alone spoke unto Dussasana,\\ntelling him. Take away this serving-woman Krishna into the inner\\napartments. And thereupon Dussasana began to drag before all the\\nspectators the helpless and modest Draupadi, trembling and crying\\npiteously unto the Pandavas her lords.\"', '', 'Draupadi said,--\\'Wait a little, thou worst of men, thou wicked-minded\\nDussasana. I have an act to perform--a high duty that hath not been\\nperformed by me yet. Dragged forcibly by this wretch\\'s strong arms, I was\\ndeprived of my senses. I salute these reverend seniors in this assembly\\nof the Kurus. That I could not do this before cannot be my fault.\\'\"', 'Vaisampayana said,--\"Dragged with greater force than before, the\\nafflicted and helpless Draupadi, undeserving of such treatment, falling\\ndown upon the ground, thus wept in that assembly of the Kurus,--', '\"\\'Alas, only once before, on the occasion of the Swayamvara, I was beheld\\nby the assembled kings in the amphitheatre, and never even once beheld\\nafterwards. I am to-day brought before this assembly. She whom even the\\nwinds and the sun had seen never before in her palace is to-day before\\nthis assembly and exposed to the gaze of the crowd. Alas, she whom the\\nsons of Pandu could not, while in her palace, suffer to be touched even\\nby the wind, is to-day suffered by the Pandavas to be seized and dragged\\nby this wretch. Alas, these Kauravas also suffer their daughter-in-law,\\nso unworthy of such treatment, to be thus afflicted before them. It\\nseemeth that the times are out of joint. What can be more distressing to\\nme, than that though high-born and chaste, I should yet be compelled to\\nenter this public court? Where is that virtue for which these kings were\\nnoted? It hath been heard that the kings of ancient days never brought\\ntheir wedded wives into the public court. Alas, that eternal usage hath\\ndisappeared from among the Kauravas. Else, how is it that the chaste wife\\nof the Pandavas, the sister of Prishata\\'s son, the friend of Vasudeva, is\\nbrought before this assembly? Ye Kauravas, I am the wedded wife of king\\nYudhishthira the just, hailing from the same dynasty to which the King\\nbelonged. Tell me now if I am a serving-maid or otherwise. I will\\ncheerfully accept your answer. This mean wretch, this destroyer of the\\nname of the Kurus, is afflicting me hard. Ye Kauravas, I cannot bear it\\nany longer. Ye kings, I desire ye to answer whether ye regard me as won\\nor unwon. I will accept your verdict whatever it be.\\'', '\"Hearing these words, Bhishma answered, I have already said, O blessed\\none that the course of morality is subtle. Even the illustrious wise in\\nthis world fail to understand it always. What in this world a strong man\\ncalls morality is regarded as such by others, however otherwise it may\\nreally be; but what a weak man calls morality is scarcely regarded as\\nsuch even if it be the highest morality. From the importance of the issue\\ninvolved, from its intricacy and subtlety, I am unable to answer with\\ncertitude the question thou hast asked. However, it is certain that as\\nall the Kurus have become the slaves of covetousness and folly, the\\ndestruction of this our race will happen on no distant date. O blessed\\none, the family into which thou hast been admitted as a daughter-in-law,\\nis such that those who are born in it, however much they might be\\nafflicted by calamities, never deviate from the paths of virtue and\\nmorality. O Princess of Panchala, this conduct of thine also, viz. that\\nthough sunk in distress, thou still easiest thy eyes on virtue and\\nmorality, is assuredly worthy of thee. These persons, Drona and others,\\nof mature years and conversant with morality, sit heads downwards like\\nmen that are dead, with bodies from which life hath departed. It seemeth\\nto me, however, that Yudhishthira is an authority on this question. It\\nbehoveth him to declare whether thou art won or not won.\"', '', 'Vaisampayana said,--\"The kings present in that assembly, from tear of\\nDuryodhana, uttered not a word, good or ill, although they beheld\\nDraupadi crying piteously in affliction like a female osprey, and\\nrepeatedly appealing to them. And the son of Dhritarashtra beholding\\nthose kings and sons and grand sons of kings all remaining silent, smiled\\na little, and addressing the daughter of the king of Panchala, said,--O\\nYajnaseni, the question thou hast put dependeth on thy husbands--on Bhima\\nof mighty strength, on Arjuna, on Nakula, on Sahadeva. Let them answer\\nthy question. O Panchali, let them for thy sake declare in the midst of\\nthese respectable men that Yudhishthira is not their lord, let them\\nthereby make king Yudhishthira the just a liar. Thou shalt then be freed\\nfrom the condition of slavery. Let the illustrious son of Dharma, always\\nadhering to virtue, who is even like Indra, himself declare whether he is\\nnot thy lord. At his words, accept thou the Pandavas or ourselves without\\ndelay. Indeed, all the Kauravas present in this assembly are floating in\\nthe ocean of thy distress. Endued with magnanimity, they are unable to\\nanswer thy question, looking at thy unfortunate husbands.\\'\"', 'Vaisampayana continued,--\"Hearing these words of the Kuru king, all who\\nwere present in the assembly loudly applauded them. And shouting\\napprovingly, they made signs unto one another by motions of their eyes\\nand lips. And amongst some that were there, sounds of distress such as\\n\\'O! and \\'Alas!\" were heard. And at these words of Duryodhana, so\\ndelightful (to his partisans), the Kauravas present in that assembly\\nbecame exceedingly glad. And the kings, with faces turned sideways,\\nlooked upon Yudhishthira conversant with the rules of morality, curious\\nto hear what he would say. And every one present in that assembly became\\ncurious to hear what Arjuna, the son of Pandu never defeated in battle,\\nand what Bhimasena, and what the twins also would say. And when that busy\\nhum of many voices became still, Bhimasena, waving his strong and\\nwell-formed arms smeared with sandalpaste spake these words,--\\'If this\\nhigh-souled king Yudhishthira the just, who is our eldest brother, had\\nnot been our lord, we would never have forgiven the Kuru race (for all\\nthis). He is the lord of all our religious and ascetic merits, the lord\\nof even our lives. If he regardeth himself as won, we too have all been\\nwon. If this were not so, who is there amongst creatures touching the\\nearth with their feet and mortal, that would escape from me with his life\\nafter having touched those locks of the princess of Panchala? Behold\\nthese mighty, well-formed arms of mine, even like maces of iron. Having\\nonce come within them, even he of a hundred sacrifices is incapable of\\neffecting an escape. Bound by the ties of virtue and the reverence that\\nis due to our eldest brother, and repeatedly urged by Arjuna to remain\\nsilent, I am not doing anything terrible. If however, I am once commanded\\nby king Yudhishthira the just, I would slay these wretched sons of\\nDhritarashtra, making slaps do the work of swords, like a lion slaying a\\nnumber of little animals.\"', 'Vaisampayana continued,--\"Unto Bhima who had spoken these words Bhishma\\nand Drona and Vidura said, \\'Forbear, O Bhima. Everything is possible with\\nthee.\\'\"', '', '\"Karna said,--\\'Of all the persons in the assembly, three, viz., Bhishma,\\nVidura, and the preceptor of the Kurus (Drona) appear to be independent;\\nfor they always speak of their master as wicked, always censure him, and\\nnever wish for his prosperity. O excellent one, the slave, the son, and\\nthe wife are always dependent. They cannot earn wealth, for whatever they\\nearn belongeth to their master. Thou art the wife of a slave incapable of\\npossessing anything on his own account. Repair now to the inner\\napartments of king Dhritarashtra and serve the king\\'s relatives. We\\ndirect that that is now thy proper business. And, O princess, all the\\nsons of Dhritarashtra and not the sons of Pritha are now thy masters. O\\nhandsome one, select thou another husband now,--one who will not make\\nthee a slave by gambling. It is well-known that women, especially that\\nare slaves, are not censurable if they proceed with freedom in electing\\nhusbands. Therefore let it be done by thee. Nakula hath been won, as also\\nBhimasena, and Yudhishthira also, and Sahadeva, and Arjuna. And, O\\nYajnaseni, thou art now a slave. Thy husbands that are slaves cannot\\ncontinue to be thy lords any longer. Alas, doth not the son of Pritha\\nregards life, prowess and manhood as of no use that he offereth this\\ndaughter of Drupada, the king of Panchala, in the presence of all this\\nassembly, as a stake at dice?\\'\"', 'Vaisampayana continued,--\"Hearing these words, the wrathful Bhima\\nbreathed hard, a very picture of woe. Obedient to the king and bound by\\nthe tie of virtue and duty, burning everything with his eyes inflamed by\\nanger, he said,--\\'O king, I cannot be angry at these words of this son of\\na Suta, for we have truly entered the state of servitude. But O king,\\ncould our enemies have said so unto me, it thou hadst not played staking\\nthis princess?\\'\"', 'Vaisampayana continued,--\"Hearing these words of Bhimasena king\\nDuryodhana addressed Yudhishthira who was silent and deprived of his\\nsenses, saying,--\\'O king, both Bhima and Arjuna, and the twins also, are\\nunder thy sway. Answer thou the question (that hath been asked by\\nDraupadi). Say, whether thou regardest Krishna as unwon.\\' And having\\nspoken thus unto the son of Kunti, Duryodhana. desirous of encouraging\\nthe son of Radha and insulting Bhima, quickly uncovered his left thigh\\nthat was like unto the stem of a plantain tree or the trunk of an\\nelephant and which was graced with every auspicious sign and endued with\\nthe strength of thunder, and showed it to Draupadi in her very sight. And\\nbeholding this, Bhimasena expanding his red eyes, said unto Duryodhana in\\nthe midst of all those kings and as if piercing them (with his dart-like\\nwords),--\\'Let not Vrikodara attain to the regions, obtained by his\\nancestors, if he doth not break that thigh of thine in the great\\nconflict. And sparkles of fire began to be emitted from every organ of\\nsense of Bhima filled with wrath, like those that come out of every crack\\nand orifice in the body of a blazing tree.', \"Vidura then, addressing everybody, said,--'Ye kings of Pratipa's race,\\nbehold the great danger that ariseth from Bhimasena. Know ye for certain\\nthat this great calamity that threatens to overtake the Bharatas hath\\nbeen sent by Destiny itself. The sons of Dhritarashtra have, indeed,\\ngambled disregarding every proper consideration. They are even now\\ndisputing in this assembly about a lady (of the royal household). The\\nprosperity of our kingdom is at an end. Alas, the Kauravas are even now\\nengaged in sinful consultations. Ye Kauravas, take to your heart this\\nhigh precept that I declare. If virtue is persecuted, the whole assembly\\nbecometh polluted. If Yudhishthira had staked her before he was himself\\nwon, he would certainly have been regarded as her master. If, however a\\nperson staketh anything at a time when he himself is incapable of holding\\nany wealth, to win it is very like obtaining wealth in a dream. Listening\\nto the words of the king of Gandhara, fall ye not off from this undoubted\\ntruth.'\", '\"Duryodhana, hearing Vidura thus speak, said,--\\'I am willing to abide by\\nthe words of Bhima, of Arjuna and of the twins. Let them say that\\nYudhishthira is not their master. Yajnaseni will then be freed from her\\nstate of bondage.\"', '\"Arjuna at this, said,--\"This illustrious son of Kunti, king Yudhishthira\\nthe just, was certainly our master before he began to play. But having\\nlost himself, let all the Kauravas judge whose master he could be after\\nthat.\"', 'Vaisampayana continued,--\"Just then, a jackal began to cry loudly in the\\nhoma-chamber of king Dhritarashtra\\'s palace. And, O king, unto the jackal\\nthat howled so, the asses began to bray responsively. And terrible birds\\nalso, from all sides, began to answer with their cries. And Vidura\\nconversant with everything and the daughter of Suvala, both understood\\nthe meaning of those terrible sounds. And Bhishma and Drona and the\\nlearned Gautama loudly cried,--Swashti! Swashti![1] Then Gandhari and the\\nlearned Vidura beholding that frightful omen, represented everything, in\\ngreat affliction, unto the king. And the king (Dhritarashtra) thereupon\\nsaid,--', \"'Thou wicked-minded Duryodhana, thou wretch, destruction hath all ready\\novertaken thee when thou insultest in language such as this the wife of\\nthese bulls among the Kurus, especially their wedded wife Draupadi. And\\nhaving spoken those words, the wise Dhritarashtra endued with knowledge,\\nreflecting with the aid of his wisdom and desirous of saving his\\nrelatives and friends from destruction, began to console Krishna, the\\nprincess of Panchala, and addressing her, the monarch said,--'Ask of me\\nany boon, O princess of Panchala, that thou desirest, Chaste and devoted\\nto virtue, thou art the first of all my daughters-in-law.\", '\"Draupadi said,--\\'O bull of the Bharata race, if thou will grant me a\\nboon, I ask the handsome Yudhishthira, obedient to every duty, be freed\\nfrom slavery. Let not unthinking children call my child Prativindhya\\nendued with great energy of mind as the son of a slave. Having been a\\nprince, so superior to all men, and nurtured by kings it is not proper\\nthat he should be called the child of a slave.', '\"Dhritarashtra said unto her,--\\'O auspicious one, let it be as thou\\nsayest. O excellent one, ask thou another boon, for I will give it. My\\nheart inclineth to give thee a second boon. Thou dost not deserve only\\none boon.', '\"Draupadi said,--\\'I ask, O king, that Bhimasena and Dhananjaya and the\\ntwins also, with their cars and bows, freed from bondage, regain their\\nliberty.\\'', \"'Dhritarashtra said,--'O blessed daughter, let it be as thou desirest.\\nAsk thou a third boon, for thou hast not been sufficiently honoured with\\ntwo boons. Virtuous in thy behaviour, thou art the foremost of all my\\ndaughters-in-law.\", 'Draupadi said,--\\'O best of kings, O illustrious one, covetousness always\\nbringeth about loss of virtue. I do not deserve a third boon. Therefore I\\ndare not ask any. O king of kings, it hath been said that a Vaisya may\\nask one boon; a Kshatriya lady, two boons; a Kshatriya male, three, and a\\nBrahmana, a hundred. O king, these my husbands freed from the wretched\\nstate of bondage, will be able to achieve prosperity by their own\\nvirtuous acts!\\'\"', '', '\"Karna said,--\\'We have never heard of such an act (as this one of\\nDraupadi), performed by any of the women noted in this world for their\\nbeauty. When the sons of both Pandu and Dhritarashtra were excited with\\nwrath, this Draupadi became unto the sons of Pandu as their salvation.\\nIndeed the princess of Panchala, becoming as a boat unto the sons of\\nPandu who were sinking in a boatless ocean of distress, hath brought them\\nin safety to the shore.\\'\"', 'Vaisampayana continued,--\"Hearing these words of Karna in the midst of\\nthe Kurus,--viz., that the sons of Pandu were saved by their wife,--the\\nangry Bhimasena in great affliction said (unto Arjuna),--\\'O Dhananjaya,\\nit hath been said by Devala three lights reside in every person, viz.,\\noffspring, acts and learning, for from these three hath sprung creation.\\nWhen life becometh extinct and the body becometh impure and is cast off\\nby relatives, these three become of service to every person. But the\\nlight that is in us hath been dimmed by this act of insult to our wife.\\nHow, O Arjuna, can a son born from this insulted wife of ours prove\\nserviceable to us?', '\"Arjuna replied,--\\'Superior persons, O Bharata, never prate about the\\nharsh words that may or may not be uttered by inferior men. Persons that\\nhave earned respect for themselves, even if they are able to retaliate,\\nremember not the acts of hostility done by their enemies, but, on the\\nother hand, treasure up only their good deeds.\\'', '\\'Bhima said,--\\'Shall I, O king, slay, without loss of time all these foes\\nassembled together, even here, or shall I destroy them, O Bharata, by the\\nroots, outside this palace? Or, what need is there of words or of\\ncommand? I shall slay all these even now, and rule thou the whole earth,\\nO king, without a rival. And saying this, Bhima with his younger\\nbrothers, like a lion in the midst of a herd of inferior animals,\\nrepeatedly cast his angry glances around. But Arjuna, however, of white\\ndeeds, with appealing looks began to pacify his elder brother. And the\\nmighty-armed hero endued with great prowess began to burn with the fire\\nof his wrath. And, O king, this fire began to issue out of Vrikodara\\'s\\nears and other senses with smoke and sparks and flames. And his face\\nbecame terrible to behold in consequence of his furrowed brows like those\\nof Yama himself at the time of the universal destruction. Then\\nYudhishthira forbade the mighty hero, embracing him with his arms and\\ntelling him \\'Be not so. Stay in silence and peace.\\' And having pacified\\nthe mighty-armed one with eyes red in wrath, the king approached his\\nuncle Dhritarashtra, with hands joined in entreaty.\"', '', '\"Yudhishthira said,--\\'O king, thou art our master. Command us as to what\\nwe shall do. O Bharata, we desire to remain always in obedience to thee.', '\"Dhritarashtra replied.--\\'O Ajatasatru, blest be thou. Go thou in peace\\nand safety. Commanded by me, go, rule thy own kingdom with thy wealth.\\nAnd, O child, take to heart this command of an old man, this wholesome\\nadvice that I give, and which is even a nutritive regimen. O\\nYudhishthira, O child, thou knowest the subtle path of morality.\\nPossessed of great wisdom, thou art also humble, and thou waitest also\\nupon the old. Where there is intelligence, there is forbearance.\\nTherefore, O Bharata, follow thou counsels of peace. The axe falleth upon\\nwood, not upon stone. (Thou art open to advice, not Duryodhana). They are\\nthe best of men that remember not the acts of hostility of their foes;\\nthat behold only the merits, not the faults, of their enemies; and that\\nnever enter into hostilities themselves. They that are good remember only\\nthe good deeds of their foes and not the hostile acts their foes might\\nhave done unto them. The good, besides, do good unto others without\\nexpectation of any good, in return. O Yudhishthira, it is only the worst\\nof men that utter harsh words in quarrelling; while they that are\\nindifferent reply to such when spoken by others. But they that are good\\nand wise never think of or recapitulate such harsh words, little caring\\nwhether these may or may not have been uttered by their foes. They that\\nare good, having regard to the state of their own feelings, can\\nunderstand the feelings of others, and therefore remember only the good\\ndeeds and not the acts of hostility of their foes. Thou hast acted even\\nas good men of prepossessing countenance do, who transgress not the\\nlimits of virtue, wealth, pleasure and salvation. O child, remember not\\nthe harsh words of Duryodhana. Look at thy mother Gandhari and myself\\nalso, if thou desirest to remember only what is good. O Bharata, look at\\nme, who am thy father unto you and am old and blind, and still alive. It\\nwas for seeing our friends and examining also the strength and weakness\\nof my children, that I had, from motives of policy, suffered this match\\nat dice to proceed. O king those amongst the Kurus that have thee for\\ntheir ruler, and the intelligent Vidura conversant with every branch of\\nlearning for their counsellor, have, indeed, nothing to grieve for. In\\nthee is virtue, in Arjuna is patience, in Bhimasena is prowess, and the\\ntwins, those foremost of men, is pure reverence for superiors. Blest be\\nthou, O Ajatasatru. Return to Khandavaprastha, and let there be brotherly\\nlove between thee and thy cousins. Let thy heart also be ever fixed on\\nvirtue.\\'\"', 'Vaisampayana continued,--\"That foremost of the Bharatas--king\\nYudhishthira the just--then, thus addressed by his uncle, having gone\\nthrough every ceremony of politeness, set out with his brothers for\\nKhandavaprastha. And accompanied by Draupadi and ascending their cars\\nwhich were all of the hue of the clouds, with cheerful hearts they all\\nset out for that best of cities called Indraprastha.\"', '']]\n"
